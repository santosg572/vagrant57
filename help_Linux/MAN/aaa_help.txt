NAME
       aa-enabled - test whether AppArmor is enabled

SYNOPSIS
       aa-enabled [options]

DESCRIPTION
       aa-enabled is used to determine if AppArmor is enabled.

OPTIONS
       aa-enabled accepts the following arguments:

       -h, --help
           Display a brief usage guide.

       -q, --quiet
           Do  not  output  anything  to stdout. This option is intended to be used by scripts that simply want to use the
           exit code to determine if AppArmor is enabled.

       -x, --exclusive
           Require AppArmor to have exclusive access to shared LSM interfaces to be considered enabled.

EXIT STATUS
       Upon exiting, aa-enabled will set its exit status to the following values:

       0   if AppArmor is enabled.

       1   if AppArmor is not enabled/loaded.

       2   intentionally not used as an aa-enabled exit status.

       3   if the AppArmor control files aren't available under /sys/kernel/security/.

       4   if aa-enabled doesn't have enough privileges to read the apparmor control files.

       10  AppArmor is enabled but does not have access to shared LSM interfaces.

       64  if any unexpected error or condition is encountered.

AGETTY(8)                                          System Administration                                         AGETTY(8)

NAME
       agetty - alternative Linux getty

SYNOPSIS
       agetty [options] port [baud_rate...] [term]

DESCRIPTION
       agetty opens a tty port, prompts for a login name and invokes the /bin/login command. It is normally invoked by
       init(8).

       agetty has several non-standard features that are useful for hardwired and for dial-in lines:

       •   Adapts the tty settings to parity bits and to erase, kill, end-of-line and uppercase characters when it reads a
           login name. The program can handle 7-bit characters with even, odd, none or space parity, and 8-bit characters
           with no parity. The following special characters are recognized: Control-U (kill); DEL and backspace (erase);
           carriage return and line feed (end of line). See also the --erase-chars and --kill-chars options.

       •   Optionally deduces the baud rate from the CONNECT messages produced by Hayes(tm)-compatible modems.

       •   Optionally does not hang up when it is given an already opened line (useful for call-back applications).

       •   Optionally does not display the contents of the /etc/issue file.

       •   Optionally displays an alternative issue files or directories instead of /etc/issue or /etc/issue.d.

       •   Optionally does not ask for a login name.

       •   Optionally invokes a non-standard login program instead of /bin/login.

       •   Optionally turns on hardware flow control.

       •   Optionally forces the line to be local with no need for carrier detect.

       This program does not use the /etc/gettydefs (System V) or /etc/gettytab (SunOS 4) files.

ARGUMENTS
       port
           A path name relative to the /dev directory. If a "-" is specified, agetty assumes that its standard input is
           already connected to a tty port and that a connection to a remote user has already been established.

           Under System V, a "-" port argument should be preceded by a "--".

       baud_rate,...
           A comma-separated list of one or more baud rates. Each time agetty receives a BREAK character it advances
           through the list, which is treated as if it were circular.

           Baud rates should be specified in descending order, so that the null character (Ctrl-@) can also be used for
           baud-rate switching.

           This argument is optional and unnecessary for virtual terminals.

           The default for serial terminals is keep the current baud rate (see --keep-baud) and if unsuccessful then
           default to '9600'.

       term
           The value to be used for the TERM environment variable. This overrides whatever init(1) may have set, and is
           inherited by login and the shell.

           The default is 'vt100', or 'linux' for Linux on a virtual terminal, or 'hurd' for GNU Hurd on a virtual
           terminal.

OPTIONS
       -8, --8bits
           Assume that the tty is 8-bit clean, hence disable parity detection.

       -a, --autologin username
           Automatically log in the specified user without asking for a username or password. Using this option causes an
           -f username option and argument to be added to the /bin/login command line. See --login-options, which can be
           used to modify this option’s behavior.

           Note that --autologin may affect the way in which getty initializes the serial line, because on auto-login
           agetty does not read from the line and it has no opportunity optimize the line setting.

       -c, --noreset
           Do not reset terminal cflags (control modes). See termios(3) for more details.

       -E, --remote
           Typically the login(1) command is given a remote hostname when called by something such as telnetd(8). This
           option allows agetty to pass what it is using for a hostname to login(1) for use in utmp(5). See --host,
           login(1), and utmp(5).

           If the --host fakehost option is given, then an -h fakehost option and argument are added to the /bin/login
           command line.

           If the --nohostname option is given, then an -H option is added to the /bin/login command line.

           See --login-options.

       -f, --issue-file path
           Specifies a ":" delimited list of files and directories to be displayed instead of /etc/issue (or other). All
           specified files and directories are displayed, missing or empty files are silently ignored. If the specified
           path is a directory then display all files with .issue file extension in version-sort order from the directory.
           This allows custom messages to be displayed on different terminals. The --noissue option will override this
           option.

       --show-issue
           Display the current issue file (or other) on the current terminal and exit. Use this option to review the
           current setting, it is not designed for any other purpose. Note that output may use some default or incomplete
           information as proper output depends on terminal and agetty command line.

       -h, --flow-control
           Enable hardware (RTS/CTS) flow control. It is left up to the application to disable software (XON/XOFF) flow
           protocol where appropriate.

       -H, --host fakehost
           Write the specified fakehost into the utmp file. Normally, no login host is given, since agetty is used for
           local hardwired connections and consoles. However, this option can be useful for identifying terminal
           concentrators and the like.

       -i, --noissue
           Do not display the contents of /etc/issue (or other) before writing the login prompt. Terminals or
           communications hardware may become confused when receiving lots of text at the wrong baud rate; dial-up scripts
           may fail if the login prompt is preceded by too much text.

       -I, --init-string initstring
           Set an initial string to be sent to the tty or modem before sending anything else. This may be used to
           initialize a modem. Non-printable characters may be sent by writing their octal code preceded by a backslash
           (\). For example, to send a linefeed character (ASCII 10, octal 012), write \12.

       -J, --noclear
           Do not clear the screen before prompting for the login name. By default the screen is cleared.

       -l, --login-program login_program
           Invoke the specified login_program instead of /bin/login. This allows the use of a non-standard login program.
           Such a program could, for example, ask for a dial-up password or use a different password file. See
           --login-options.

       -L, --local-line[=mode]
           Control the CLOCAL line flag. The optional mode argument is auto, always or never. If the mode argument is
           omitted, then the default is always. If the --local-line option is not given at all, then the default is auto.

           always
               Forces the line to be a local line with no need for carrier detect. This can be useful when you have a
               locally attached terminal where the serial line does not set the carrier-detect signal.

           never
               Explicitly clears the CLOCAL flag from the line setting and the carrier-detect signal is expected on the
               line.

           auto
               The agetty default. Does not modify the CLOCAL setting and follows the setting enabled by the kernel.

       -m, --extract-baud
           Try to extract the baud rate from the CONNECT status message produced by Hayes(tm)-compatible modems. These
           status messages are of the form: "<junk><speed><junk>". agetty assumes that the modem emits its status message
           at the same speed as specified with (the first) baud_rate value on the command line.

           Since the --extract-baud feature may fail on heavily-loaded systems, you still should enable BREAK processing
           by enumerating all expected baud rates on the command line.

       --list-speeds
           Display supported baud rates. These are determined at compilation time.

       -n, --skip-login
           Do not prompt the user for a login name. This can be used in connection with the --login-program option to
           invoke a non-standard login process such as a BBS system. Note that with the --skip-login option, agetty gets
           no input from the user who logs in and therefore will not be able to figure out parity, character size, and
           newline processing of the connection. It defaults to space parity, 7 bit characters, and ASCII CR (13)
           end-of-line character. Beware that the program that agetty starts (usually /bin/login) is run as root.

       -N, --nonewline
           Do not print a newline before writing out /etc/issue.

       -o, --login-options login_options
           Options and arguments that are passed to login(1). Where \u is replaced by the login name. For example:

           --login-options '-h darkstar -- \u'

           See --autologin, --login-program and --remote.

           Please read the SECURITY NOTICE below before using this option.

       -p, --login-pause
           Wait for any key before dropping to the login prompt. Can be combined with --autologin to save memory by lazily
           spawning shells.

       -r, --chroot directory
           Change root to the specified directory.

       -R, --hangup
           Call vhangup(2) to do a virtual hangup of the specified terminal.

       -s, --keep-baud
           Try to keep the existing baud rate. The baud rates from the command line are used when agetty receives a BREAK
           character. If another baud rates specified then the original baud rate is also saved to the end of the wanted
           baud rates list. This can be used to return to the original baud rate after unexpected BREAKs.

       -t, --timeout timeout
           Terminate if no user name could be read within timeout seconds. Use of this option with hardwired terminal
           lines is not recommended.

       -U, --detect-case
           Turn on support for detecting an uppercase-only terminal. This setting will detect a login name containing only
           capitals as indicating an uppercase-only terminal and turn on some upper-to-lower case conversions. Note that
           this has no support for any Unicode characters.

       -w, --wait-cr
           Wait for the user or the modem to send a carriage-return or a linefeed character before sending the /etc/issue
           file (or others) and the login prompt. This is useful with the --init-string option.

       --nohints
           Do not print hints about Num, Caps and Scroll Locks.

       --nohostname
           By default the hostname will be printed. With this option enabled, no hostname at all will be shown. This
           setting is also possible to able by LOGIN_PLAIN_PROMPT option in the /etc/login.defs configuration file (see
           below for more details).

       --long-hostname
           By default the hostname is only printed until the first dot. With this option enabled, the fully qualified
           hostname by gethostname(3P) or (if not found) by getaddrinfo(3) is shown.

       --erase-chars string
           This option specifies additional characters that should be interpreted as a backspace ("ignore the previous
           character") when the user types the login name. The default additional 'erase' has been '#', but since
           util-linux 2.23 no additional erase characters are enabled by default.

       --kill-chars string
           This option specifies additional characters that should be interpreted as a kill ("ignore all previous
           characters") when the user types the login name. The default additional 'kill' has been '@', but since
           util-linux 2.23 no additional kill characters are enabled by default.

       --chdir directory
           Change directory before the login.

       --delay number
           Sleep seconds before open tty.

       --nice number
           Run login with this priority.

       --reload
           Ask all running agetty instances to reload and update their displayed prompts, if the user has not yet
           commenced logging in. After doing so the command will exit. This feature might be unsupported on systems
           without Linux inotify(7).

       -h, --help
           Display help text and exit.

       -V, --version
           Print version and exit.

CONFIG FILE ITEMS
       agetty reads the /etc/login.defs configuration file (see login.defs(5)). Note that the configuration file could be
       distributed with another package (usually shadow-utils). The following configuration items are relevant for agetty:

       LOGIN_PLAIN_PROMPT (boolean)
           Tell agetty that printing the hostname should be suppressed in the login: prompt. This is an alternative to the
           --nohostname command line option. The default value is no.

EXAMPLE
       This section shows examples for the process field of an entry in the /etc/inittab file. You’ll have to prepend
       appropriate values for the other fields. See inittab(5) for more details.

       For a hardwired line or a console tty:

          /sbin/agetty 9600 ttyS1

       For a directly connected terminal without proper carrier-detect wiring (try this if your terminal just sleeps
       instead of giving you a password: prompt):

          /sbin/agetty --local-line 9600 ttyS1 vt100

       For an old-style dial-in line with a 9600/2400/1200 baud modem:

          /sbin/agetty --extract-baud --timeout 60 ttyS1 9600,2400,1200

       For a Hayes modem with a fixed 115200 bps interface to the machine (the example init string turns off modem echo
       and result codes, makes modem/computer DCD track modem/modem DCD, makes a DTR drop cause a disconnection, and turns
       on auto-answer after 1 ring):

          /sbin/agetty --wait-cr --init-string 'ATE0Q1&D2&C1S0=1\015' 115200 ttyS1

SECURITY NOTICE
       If you use the --login-program and --login-options options, be aware that a malicious user may try to enter
       lognames with embedded options, which then get passed to the used login program. agetty does check for a leading
       "-" and makes sure the logname gets passed as one parameter (so embedded spaces will not create yet another
       parameter), but depending on how the login binary parses the command line that might not be sufficient. Check that
       the used login program cannot be abused this way.

       Some programs use "--" to indicate that the rest of the command line should not be interpreted as options. Use this
       feature if available by passing "--" before the username gets passed by \u.

ISSUE FILES
       The default issue file is /etc/issue. If the file exists, then agetty also checks for /etc/issue.d directory. The
       directory is optional extension to the default issue file and content of the directory is printed after /etc/issue
       content. If the /etc/issue does not exist, then the directory is ignored. All files with .issue extension from the
       directory are printed in version-sort order. The directory can be used to maintain 3rd-party messages independently
       on the primary system /etc/issue file.

       Since version 2.35 additional locations for issue file and directory are supported. If the default /etc/issue does
       not exist, then agetty checks for /run/issue and /run/issue.d, thereafter for /usr/lib/issue and /usr/lib/issue.d.
       The directory /etc is expected for host specific configuration, /run is expected for generated stuff and /usr/lib
       for static distribution maintained configuration.

       The default path maybe overridden by --issue-file option. In this case specified path has to be file or directory
       and all the default issue file and directory locations are ignored.

       The issue file feature can be completely disabled by --noissue option.

       It is possible to review the current issue file by agetty --show-issue on the current terminal.

       The issue files may contain certain escape codes to display the system name, date, time et cetera. All escape codes
       consist of a backslash (\) immediately followed by one of the characters listed below.

       4 or 4{interface}
           Insert the IPv4 address of the specified network interface (for example: \4{eth0}). If the interface argument
           is not specified, then select the first fully configured (UP, non-LOCALBACK, RUNNING) interface. If no
           configured interface is found, fall back to the IP address of the machine’s hostname.

       6 or 6{interface}
           The same as \4 but for IPv6.

       b
           Insert the baudrate of the current line.

       d
           Insert the current date.

       e or e{name}
           Translate the human-readable name to an escape sequence and insert it (for example: \e{red}Alert
           text.\e{reset}). If the name argument is not specified, then insert \033. The currently supported names are:
           black, blink, blue, bold, brown, cyan, darkgray, gray, green, halfbright, lightblue, lightcyan, lightgray,
           lightgreen, lightmagenta, lightred, magenta, red, reset, reverse, yellow and white. All unknown names are
           silently ignored.

       s
           Insert the system name (the name of the operating system). Same as 'uname -s'. See also the \S escape code.

       S or S{VARIABLE}
           Insert the VARIABLE data from /etc/os-release. If this file does not exist then fall back to
           /usr/lib/os-release. If the VARIABLE argument is not specified, then use PRETTY_NAME from the file or the
           system name (see \s). This escape code can be used to keep /etc/issue distribution and release independent.
           Note that \S{ANSI_COLOR} is converted to the real terminal escape sequence.

       l
           Insert the name of the current tty line.

       m
           Insert the architecture identifier of the machine. Same as uname -m.

       n
           Insert the nodename of the machine, also known as the hostname. Same as uname -n.

       o
           Insert the NIS domainname of the machine. Same as hostname -d.

       O
           Insert the DNS domainname of the machine.

       r
           Insert the release number of the OS. Same as uname -r.

       t
           Insert the current time.

       u
           Insert the number of current users logged in.

       U
           Insert the string "1 user" or "<n> users" where <n> is the number of current users logged in.

       v
           Insert the version of the OS, that is, the build-date and such.

       An example. On my system, the following /etc/issue file:

           This is \n.\o (\s \m \r) \t

       displays as:

           This is thingol.orcan.dk (Linux i386 1.1.9) 18:29:30

FILES
       /var/run/utmp
           the system status file.

       /etc/issue
           printed before the login prompt.

       /etc/os-release /usr/lib/os-release
           operating system identification data.

       /dev/console
           problem reports (if syslog(3) is not used).

       /etc/inittab
           init(8) configuration file for SysV-style init daemon.

BUGS
       The baud-rate detection feature (the --extract-baud option) requires that agetty be scheduled soon enough after
       completion of a dial-in call (within 30 ms with modems that talk at 2400 baud). For robustness, always use the
       --extract-baud option in combination with a multiple baud rate command-line argument, so that BREAK processing is
       enabled.

       The text in the /etc/issue file (or other) and the login prompt are always output with 7-bit characters and space
       parity.

       The baud-rate detection feature (the --extract-baud option) requires that the modem emits its status message after
       raising the DCD line.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Depending on how the program was configured, all diagnostics are written to the console device or reported via the
       syslog(3) facility. Error messages are produced if the port argument does not specify a terminal device; if there
       is no utmp entry for the current process (System V only); and so on.

NAME
       apgbfm - APG Bloom filter management program

SYNOPSIS
       apgbfm -f filter -n numofwords [-q] [-s]
       apgbfm -f filter -d dictfile [-q] [-s]
       apgbfm -f filter -a word [-q]
       apgbfm -f filter -A dictfile [-q]
       apgbfm -f filter -c word [-q]
       apgbfm -f filter -C dictfile [-q]
       apgbfm -i filter
       apgbfm [-v] [-h]

DESCRIPTION
       apgbfm  is used to manage Bloom filter that is used to restrict password generation in APG pasword generation soft‐
       ware. Usage of the Bloom filter allows to speed up password check for large dictionaries and has some  other  bene‐
       fits.

       The  idea  to  use  Bloom filter for that purpose is came from the description of the OPUS project OPUS: Preventing
       Weak Password Choices Purdue Technical Report CSD-TR 92-028 writen by Eugene H. Spafford.

       You can obtain this article from:
       http://www.cerias.purdue.edu/homes/spaf/tech-reps/9128.ps
       It has very nice description of Bloom filter and it's advantages for password checking systems.

       In simple words, apgbfm generates n hash values for every word and sets corresponding bits in filter file to 1.  To
       check  the  word  apgbfm  generates the same hash functions for that word and if all n corresponding bits in filter
       file are set to 1 then it suppose that word exists in dicionary.  apgbfm uses SHA-1 as a hash function.

       apgbfm can be used as standalone utility, not only with apg, or apgd.

       WARNING !!!
              Filter file format can be changed in the future. I'll try to make file formats  compatible  but  i  can  not
              guaranty this.

       WARNING !!!
              apgbfm may slow down your computer during filter creation.

OPTIONS
       -f filter
              use filter as the name for Bloom filter filename.

       -i filter
              print information about filter.

       -n numofwords
              create new empty filter for numofwords number of words. Useful when you want to fill filter dynamicaly.

       -d dictfile
              create new filter from dictfile. It may take a lot of time to generate filter from a big dictionary. In that
              dictionary  you  may place words (one per line) that should not appear as generated passwords.  For example:
              user names common words, etc. You even can use one of the dictionaries that come  with  dictionary  password
              crackers.   This  check is case sensitive. For example, if you want to reject word 'root', you should insert
              in dictfile words: root, Root, RoOt, ... , ROOT.  To indicate that program is working apgbfm prints dot  for
              every 100 words added in dictionary.

       -a word
              add word to the filter.

       -A dictfile
              add  all  words from dictfile to the filter. To indicate that program is working apgbfm prints dot for every
              100 words added in dictionary.

       -c word
              check word for appearance in the filter.

       -C dictfile
              check every word from dictfile for appearance in the filter.

       -q     quiet mode.

       -s     create new filter in case-insensitive mode.

       -v     print version information.

       -h     print help information.

EXIT CODE
       On successful completion of its task, apgbfm will complete with exit code 0.  An exit code of -1 indicates an error
       occurred.  Textual errors are written to the standard error stream.

FILES
       None.

BUGS
       None.  If you've found one, please send bug description to the author.

APT-CONFIG(8)                                               APT                                              APT-CONFIG(8)

NAME
       apt-config - APT Configuration Query program

SYNOPSIS

       apt-config [--empty] [--format '%f "%v";%n'] [-o=config_string] [-c=config_file] {shell | dump | {-v | --version} |
                  {-h | --help}}

DESCRIPTION
       apt-config is an internal program used by various portions of the APT suite to provide consistent configurability.
       It accesses the main configuration file /etc/apt/apt.conf in a manner that is easy to use for scripted
       applications.

       Unless the -h, or --help option is given, one of the commands below must be present.

       shell
           shell is used to access the configuration information from a shell script. It is given pairs of arguments, the
           first being a shell variable and the second the configuration value to query. As output it lists shell
           assignment commands for each value present. In a shell script it should be used as follows:

               OPTS="-f"
               RES=`apt-config shell OPTS MyApp::options`
               eval $RES
           This will set the shell environment variable $OPTS to the value of MyApp::options with a default of -f.

           The configuration item may be postfixed with a /[fdbi]. f returns file names, d returns directories, b returns
           true or false and i returns an integer. Each of the returns is normalized and verified internally.

       dump
           Just show the contents of the configuration space.

OPTIONS
       All command line options may be set using the configuration file, the descriptions indicate the configuration
       option to set. For boolean options you can override the config file by using something like -f-,--no-f, -f=no or
       several other variations.

       --empty
           Include options which have an empty value. This is the default, so use --no-empty to remove them from the
           output.

       --format '%f "%v";%n'
           Defines the output of each config option. %t will be replaced with its individual name, %f with its full
           hierarchical name and %v with its value. Use uppercase letters and special characters in the value will be
           encoded to ensure that it can e.g. be safely used in a quoted-string as defined by RFC822. Additionally %n will
           be replaced by a newline, and %N by a tab. A % can be printed by using %%.

       -h, --help
           Show a short usage summary.

       -v, --version
           Show the program version.

       -c, --config-file
           Configuration File; Specify a configuration file to use. The program will read the default configuration file
           and then this configuration file. If configuration settings need to be set before the default configuration
           files are parsed specify a file with the APT_CONFIG environment variable. See apt.conf(5) for syntax
           information.

       -o, --option
           Set a Configuration Option; This will set an arbitrary configuration option. The syntax is -o Foo::Bar=bar.  -o
           and --option can be used multiple times to set different options.

DIAGNOSTICS
       apt-config returns zero on normal operation, decimal 100 on error.

NAME
       aa-exec - confine a program with the specified AppArmor profile

SYNOPSIS
       aa-exec [options] [--] [<command> ...]

DESCRIPTION
       aa-exec is used to launch a program confined by the specified profile and or namespace.  If both a profile and
       namespace are specified command will be confined by profile in the new policy namespace.  If only a namespace is
       specified, the profile name of the current confinement will be used.  If neither a profile or namespace is
       specified command will be run using standard profile attachment (ie. as if run without the aa-exec command).

       If the arguments are to be pasted to the <command> being invoked by aa-exec then -- should be used to separate aa-
       exec arguments from the command.
         aa-exec -p profile1 -- ls -l

OPTIONS aa-exec accepts the following arguments:
       -p PROFILE, --profile=PROFILE
           confine  <command>  with  PROFILE.  If  the  PROFILE  is  not  specified  use  the current profile name (likely
           unconfined).

       -n NAMESPACE, --namespace=NAMESPACE
           use profiles in NAMESPACE.  This will result in confinement transitioning to using the new profile namespace.

       -i, --immediate
           transition to PROFILE before doing executing <command>.  This subjects the running of  <command>  to  the  exec
           transition rules of the current profile.

       -v, --verbose
           show commands being performed

       -d, --debug
           show commands and error codes

       --  Signal  the  end  of  options and disables further option processing. Any arguments after the -- are treated as
           arguments of the command.  This is useful when passing arguments to the <command> being invoked by aa-exec.

NAME
       arecord, aplay - command-line sound recorder and player for ALSA soundcard driver

SYNOPSIS
       arecord [flags] [filename]
       aplay [flags] [filename [filename]] ...

DESCRIPTION
       arecord  is  a  command-line soundfile recorder for the ALSA soundcard driver. It supports several file formats and
       multiple soundcards with multiple devices. If recording with interleaved mode samples  the  file  is  automatically
       split before the 2GB filesize.

       aplay is much the same, only it plays instead of recording. For supported soundfile formats, the sampling rate, bit
       depth, and so forth can be automatically determined from the soundfile header.

       If filename is not specified, the standard output or input is used. The aplay utility accepts multiple filenames.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Help: show syntax.

       --version
              Print current version.

       -l, --list-devices
              List all soundcards and digital audio devices

       -L, --list-pcms
              List all PCMs defined

       -D, --device=NAME
              Select PCM by name

       -q --quiet
              Quiet mode. Suppress messages (not sound :))

       -t, --file-type TYPE
              File type (voc, wav, raw or au).  If this parameter is omitted the WAVE format is used.

       -c, --channels=#
              The number of channels.  The default is one channel.  Valid values are 1 through 32.

       -f --format=FORMAT
              Sample format
              Recognized  sample  formats are: S8 U8 S16_LE S16_BE U16_LE U16_BE S24_LE S24_BE U24_LE U24_BE S32_LE S32_BE
              U32_LE U32_BE FLOAT_LE FLOAT_BE FLOAT64_LE FLOAT64_BE  IEC958_SUBFRAME_LE  IEC958_SUBFRAME_BE  MU_LAW  A_LAW
              IMA_ADPCM  MPEG  GSM SPECIAL S24_3LE S24_3BE U24_3LE U24_3BE S20_3LE S20_3BE U20_3LE U20_3BE S18_3LE S18_3BE
              U18_3LE
              Some of these may not be available on selected hardware
              The available format shortcuts are:
              -f cd (16 bit little endian, 44100, stereo) [-f S16_LE -c2 -r44100]
              -f cdr (16 bit big endian, 44100, stereo) [-f S16_BE -c2 -r44100]
              -f dat (16 bit little endian, 48000, stereo) [-f S16_LE -c2 -r48000]
              If no format is given U8 is used.

       -r, --rate=#<Hz>
              Sampling rate in Hertz. The default rate is 8000 Hertz.  If the value specified is  less  than  300,  it  is
              taken as the rate in kilohertz.  Valid values are 2000 through 192000 Hertz.

       -d, --duration=#
              Interrupt after # seconds.  A value of zero means infinity.  The default is zero, so if this option is omit‐
              ted  then  the record/playback process will run until it is killed.  Either '-d' or '-s' option is available
              exclusively.

       -s, --samples=#
              Interrupt after transmission of # PCM frames.  A value of zero means infinity.  The default is zero,  so  if
              this  options  is omitted then the record/playback process will run until it is killed.  Either '-d' or '-s'
              option is available exclusively.

       -M, --mmap
              Use memory-mapped (mmap) I/O mode for the audio stream.  If this option is not set, the read/write I/O  mode
              will be used.

       -N, --nonblock
              Open  the  audio  device  in non-blocking mode. If the device is busy the program will exit immediately.  If
              this option is not set the program will block until the audio device is available again.

       -F, --period-time=#
              Distance between interrupts is # microseconds.  If no period time and no period size is given then a quarter
              of the buffer time is set.

       -B, --buffer-time=#
              Buffer duration is # microseconds If no buffer time and no buffer size is given  then  the  maximal  allowed
              buffer time but not more than 500ms is set.

       --period-size=#
              Distance  between interrupts is # frames If no period size and no period time is given then a quarter of the
              buffer size is set.

       --buffer-size=#
              Buffer duration is # frames If no buffer time and no buffer size is given then the  maximal  allowed  buffer
              time but not more than 500ms is set.

       -A, --avail-min=#
              Min available space for wakeup is # microseconds

       -R, --start-delay=#
              Delay for automatic PCM start is # microseconds (relative to buffer size if <= 0)

       -T, --stop-delay=#
              Delay for automatic PCM stop is # microseconds from xrun

       -v, --verbose
              Show  PCM  structure  and setup.  This option is accumulative.  The VU meter is displayed when this is given
              twice or three times.

       -V, --vumeter=TYPE
              Specifies the VU-meter type, either stereo or mono.  The stereo VU-meter is  available  only  for  2-channel
              stereo samples with interleaved format.

       -I, --separate-channels
              One  file  for each channel.  This option disables max-file-time and use-strftime, and ignores SIGUSR1.  The
              stereo VU meter is not available with separate channels.

       -P     Playback.  This is the default if the program is invoked by typing aplay.

       -C     Record.  This is the default if the program is invoked by typing arecord.

       -i, --interactive
              Allow interactive operation via stdin.  Currently only pause/resume via space or enter key is implemented.

       -m, --chmap=ch1,ch2,...
              Give the channel map to override or follow.  Pass channel position strings like FL, FR, etc.

              If a device supports the override of the channel map, aplay tries to pass the  given  channel  map.   If  it
              doesn't  support  the channel map override but still it provides the channel map information, aplay tries to
              rearrange the channel order in the buffer to match with the returned channel map from the device.

       --disable-resample
              Disable automatic rate resample.

       --disable-channels
              Disable automatic channel conversions.

       --disable-format
              Disable automatic format conversions.

       --disable-softvol
              Disable software volume control (softvol).

       --test-position
              Test ring buffer position.

       --test-coef=<coef>
              Test coefficient for ring buffer position; default is 8.  Expression for validation is: coef *  (buffer_size
              / 2).  Minimum value is 1.

       --test-nowait
              Do not wait for the ring buffer ‐ eats the whole CPU.

       --max-file-time
              While  recording,  when  the  output file has been accumulating sound for this long, close it and open a new
              output file.  Default is the maximum size supported by the file format: 2 GiB for WAV  files.   This  option
              has no effect if  --separate-channels is specified.

       --process-id-file <file name>
              aplay writes its process ID here, so other programs can send signals to it.

       --use-strftime
              When recording, interpret %-codes in the file name parameter using the strftime facility whenever the output
              file  is  opened.  The important strftime codes are: %Y is the year, %m month, %d day of the month, %H hour,
              %M minute and %S second.  In addition, %v is the file number, starting at 1.  When this option is specified,
              intermediate directories for the output file are created automatically.  This option has no effect if --sep‐
              arate-channels is specified.

       --dump-hw-params
              Dump hw_params of the device preconfigured status to stderr. The dump lists capabilities of the selected de‐
              vice such as supported formats, sampling rates, numbers of channels, period  and  buffer  bytes/sizes/times.
              For raw device hw:X this option basically lists hardware capabilities of the soundcard.

       --fatal-errors
              Disables recovery attempts when errors (e.g. xrun) are encountered; the aplay process instead aborts immedi‐
              ately.

SIGNALS
       When  recording,  SIGINT,  SIGTERM  and SIGABRT will close the output file and exit.  SIGUSR1 will close the output
       file, open a new one, and continue recording.  However, SIGUSR1 does not work with --separate-channels.

EXAMPLES
       aplay -c 1 -t raw -r 22050 -f mu_law foobar
              will play the raw file "foobar" as a 22050-Hz, mono, 8-bit, Mu-Law .au file.

       arecord -d 10 -f cd -t wav -D copy foobar.wav
              will record foobar.wav as a 10-second, CD-quality wave file, using the PCM "copy" (which might be defined in
              the user's .asoundrc file as:
              pcm.copy {
                type plug
                slave {
                  pcm hw
                }
                route_policy copy
              }

       arecord -t wav --max-file-time 30 mon.wav
              Record from the default audio source in monaural, 8,000 samples per second, 8 bits per sample.  Start a  new
              file every 30 seconds.  File names are mon-nn.wav, where nn increases from 01.  The file after mon-99.wav is
              mon-100.wav.

       arecord -f cd -t wav --max-file-time 3600 --use-strftime %Y/%m/%d/listen-%H-%M-%v.wav
              Record  in stereo from the default audio source.  Create a new file every hour.  The files are placed in di‐
              rectories based on their start dates and have names which include their start times and file numbers.

NAME
       aptd - package managing daemon proving a D-Bus interface

SYNOPSIS
       aptd [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       aptd allows to perform package management tasks, e.g. installing or removing software, using a D-Bus interface. The
       privileges  are  handled  by  PolicyKit  so the client application doesn't need to run as root. Furthermore aptd is
       started by D-Bus activation only when an user calls a method.

OPTIONS
       -d, --debug
              Show additional information on the command line.

       -h, --help
              Show information about the usage of the command.

       -r, --replace
              Replace another aptd instance if it is running.

       -p PROFILE_FILE
              Write profiling data to PROFILE_FILE using Python's profiler. This is only of use to developers.

       -t, --disable-timeout
              Do not shutdown the daemon after an idle time.

       --dummy
              Instead of applying the changes to the system only show a progress. This option is only usable for  develop‐
              ers to locate problems in client applications.

FILES
       /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20dbus
              Adds  a small post update hook which will emit the org.debian.apt.CacheChanged signal on the system D-Bus to
              indicate that the cache has been changed and a possible running aptd instance should  reloade  its  internal
              cache.

       /usr/share/polkit-1/actions/org.debian.apt.policy
              The PolicyKit definitions of the privileges used by aptdaemon, e.g. to install packages. To change the priv‐
              ileges please have a look at PolicyKit.conf(1).

       /etc/dbus-1/system.d/org.debian.apt.conf
              The D-Bus configuration of the org.debian.apt name space.

DIAGNOSTICS
       By default aptdaemon logs to the syslog facility AptDaemon. Furthermore you can use the -d option to get additional
       information on the command line.

NAME
       aplaymidi - play Standard MIDI Files

SYNOPSIS
       aplaymidi -p client:port[,...] [-d delay] midifile ...

DESCRIPTION
       aplaymidi is a command-line utility that plays the specified MIDI file(s) to one or more ALSA sequencer ports.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Prints a list of options.

       -V, --version
              Prints the current version.

       -l, --list
              Prints a list of possible output ports.

       -p, --port=client:port,...
              Sets the sequencer port(s) to which the events in the MIDI file(s) are sent.

              A  client can be specified by its number, its name, or a prefix of its name. A port is specified by its num‐
              ber; for port 0 of a client, the ":0" part of the port specification can be omitted.

              Multiple ports can be specified to allow playback of MIDI file(s) that contain events for  multiple  devices
              (ports), as specified by "Port Number" meta events.

              For  compatibility  with  pmidi(1),  the  port specification is taken from the ALSA_OUTPUT_PORTS environment
              variable if none is given on the command line.

       -d, --delay=seconds
              Specifies how long to wait after the end of each MIDI file, to allow the last notes to die away.

BUGS
       aplaymidi handles "Port Number" meta events, but not "Port Name" meta events.

              into quotation marks.

       --reinstall PACKAGES
              Reinstall the list of PACKAGES. If you want to reinstall more than one package you have to put  the  package
              names into quotation marks.

       -r, --remove PACKAGES
              Remove  the  list of PACKAGES. If you want to remove more than one package you have to put the package names
              into quotation marks.

       -p, --purge PACKAGES
              Purge the list of PACKAGES. If you want to purge more than one package you have to  put  the  package  names
              into quotation marks.

       -u, --upgrade PACKAGES
              Upgrade the list of PACKAGES. If you want to upgrade more than one package you have to put the package names
              into quotation marks.

       --upgrade-system
              Upgrade the whole system.

       --fix-install
              Try to complete a previously cancelled installation by calling "dpkg --configure -a".

       --fix-depends
              Try  to resolve unsatisified dependencies. Attention: Currently you don't get a confirmation of the changes,
              which makes this method quite dangerous since it could remove a lot of packages.

       --add-vendor-key PUBLIC_KEY_FILE
              Install the PUBLIC_KEY_FILE to authenticate and trust packages singed by the vendor.

       --add-vendor-key-from-keyserver PUBLIC_KEY_ID

              Allow to install software from the repository specified by the given DEB_LINE. You  have  to  put  quotation
              marks  around  the DEB_LINE since it normally contains spaces: ´deb http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian unstable
              main´

       --sources-file SOURCES_FILE
              Specify an alternative sources file to which the new repository should be written.  SOURCES_FILE  should  be

              Show all trusted software vendors and theirs keys.

       --hide-terminal
              Do not attach to the interactive terminal of the underlying dpkg call.

       --allow-unauthenticated
              Allow to install packages which are not from a trusted vendor.

EXAMPLES
       The following command will install the package xterm and remove the package eterm in the same run:
              $ aptdcon --install "xterm" --remove "eterm"

       To  handle  more than one package the names have to be put into quotation marks. The following command will install
       xterm and eterm:
              $ aptdcon --install "xterm eterm"

       The  following  command  will  add  the  backport   repository   to   the   sources.list   in   a   separate   file
       /etc/apt/sources.list.d/backports.list :
              $ aptdcon --sources-file backports.list \
                  --add-repostiry "deb http://archive.backports.org/debian stable main"

DIAGNOSTICS
       By default aptdaemon logs to the syslog facility AptDaemon. Furthermore you can use the -d option to get additional
       information on the command line.

NAME
       apparmor_parser - loads AppArmor profiles into the kernel

SYNOPSIS
       apparmor_parser [options] <command> [profiles]...

       apparmor_parser [options] <command>

       apparmor_parser [-hv] [--help] [--version]

DESCRIPTION
       apparmor_parser is used as a general tool to compile, and manage AppArmor policy, including loading new
       apparmor.d(5) profiles into the Linux kernel.

       AppArmor profiles restrict the operations available to processes.

       The profiles are loaded into the Linux kernel by the apparmor_parser program. The profiles may be specified by file
       name or a directory name containing a set of profiles. If a directory is specified then the apparmor_parser will
       try to do a profile load for each file in the directory that is not a dot file, or explicitly black listed
       (*.dpkg-new, *.dpkg-old, *.dpkg-dist, *.dpkg-bak, *.dpkg-remove, *.pacsave, *.pacnew, *.rpmnew, *.rpmsave, *.orig,
       *.rej, *~).  The apparmor_parser will fall back to taking input from standard input if a profile or directory is
       not supplied.

       The input supplied to apparmor_parser should be in the format described in apparmor.d(5).

COMMANDS
       The command set is broken into four subcategories.

       unprivileged commands
           Commands that don't require any privilege and don't operate on profiles.

       unprivileged profile commands
           Commands  that  operate  on a profile either specified on the command line or read from stdin if no profile was
           specified.

       privileged commands
           Commands that require the MAC_ADMIN capability within the affected AppArmor namespace to load policy  into  the
           kernel or filesystem write permissions to update the affected privileged files (cache etc).

       privileged profile commands
           Commands that require privilege and operate on profiles.

Unprivileged commands
       -V, --version
           Print the version number and exit.

       -h, --help
           Give a quick reference guide.

Unprivileged profile commands
       -N, --names
           Produce a list of policies from a given set of profiles (implies -K).

       -p, --preprocess
           Apply preprocessing to the input profile(s) by flattening includes into the output profile and dump to stdout.

       -S, --stdout
           Writes a binary (cached) profile to stdout (implies -K and -T).

       -o file, --ofile file
           Writes a binary (cached) profile to the specified file (implies -K and -T)

Privileged commands
       --purge-cache
           Unconditionally clear out cached profiles.

Privileged profile commands
       -a, --add
           Insert  the AppArmor definitions given into the kernel. This is the default action. This gives an error message
           if a AppArmor definition by the same name already exists in the kernel, or if the parser doesn't understand its
           input. It reports when an addition succeeded.

       -r, --replace
           This flag is required if an AppArmor definition by the same name already exists in the kernel; used to  replace
           the definition already in the kernel with the definition given on standard input.

       -R, --remove
           This  flag  is  used  to  remove  an  AppArmor definition already in the kernel.  Note that it still requires a
           complete AppArmor definition as described in apparmor.d(5) even though the contents of  the  definition  aren't
           used.

OPTIONS
       -B, --binary
           Treat  the  profile  files  specified  on  the command line (or stdin if none specified) as binary cache files,
           produced with the -S or -o options, and load to the kernel as specified by -a, -r, and -R (implies -K and -T).

       -C, --Complain
           Force the profile to load in complain mode.

       -b n, --base n
           Set the base directory for resolving #include directives defined as relative paths.

       -I n, --Include n
           Add element n to the search path when resolving #include directives defined as an absolute paths.

       -f n, --apparmorfs n
           Set the location of the apparmor security filesystem (default is "/sys/kernel/security/apparmor").

       --policy-features n
           Specify the feature set that the policy was developed under. This does not override feature ABI rules.

       --override-policy-abi n
           Specify the feature set that the policy was developed under and override any feature ABI rules that the  policy
           may be using.

       --kernel-features n
           Specify  the  feature  set  of  the kernel that the policy is being compiled for. If not specified this will be
           determined by the system's kernel.

       -M n, --features-file n
           Use the features file located at path "n" (default  is  /etc/apparmor.d/cache/.features).  If  the  --cache-loc
           option is present, the ".features" file in the specified cache directory is used.

           Note: this sets both the --kernel-features and --policy-features to be the same.

       -m n, --match-string n
           Only use match features "n".

           Note: this sets both the --kernel-features and --policy-features to be the same.

       -n n, --namespace-string n
           Force a profile to load in the namespace "n".

       -X, --readimpliesX
           In  the  case  of  profiles that are loading on systems were READ_IMPLIES_EXEC is set in the kernel for a given
           process, load the profile so that any "r" flags are processed as "mr".

       -k, --show-cache
           Report the cache processing (hit/miss details) when loading or saving cached profiles.

       -K, --skip-cache
           Perform no caching at all: disables -W, implies -T.

       -T, --skip-read-cache
           By default, if a profile's cache is found in the location specified by --cache-loc and the timestamp  is  newer
           than the profile, it will be loaded from the cache. This option disables this cache loading behavior.

       -W, --write-cache
           Write  out  cached  profiles  to  the  location  specified  in  --cache-loc.   Off  by  default. In cases where
           abstractions have been changed, and the parser is running with "--replace", it  may  make  sense  to  also  use
           "--skip-read-cache" with the "--write-cache" option.

       --skip-bad-cache
           Skip updating the cache if it contains cached profiles in a bad or inconsistent state

       -L, --cache-loc
           Set the location(s) of the cache directory. This option can accept a comma separated list of directories, which
           will  be  searched  in  order  to  find a matching cache. The first matching cache file found is used even if a
           directory later in the search order may contain a newer cache file.

           If multiple directories are specified and --write-cache has been specified then cache writes will  be  made  to
           the first directory in the list, all other directories will be treated as read only.

           If  a  cache directory name needs to have a comma as part of the name, it can be specified by using a backslash
           to escape the comma character in the directory name.

           If not specified the cache location defaults to /var/cache/apparmor

       --print-cache-dir
           Print the cache directory location. This path will be a subdirectory of the directory specified by --cache-loc.
           The subdirectory used will be influenced by the features available in the currently running kernel  or  by  the
           features specified with the --match-string or --features-file options.

       -Q, --skip-kernel-load
           Perform all actions except the actual loading of a profile into the kernel.  This is useful for testing profile
           generation, caching, etc, without making changes to the running kernel profiles.

           This also removes the need for privilege to execute the commands that manage policy in the kernel

       -q, --quiet
           Do not report on the profiles as they are loaded, and not show warnings.

       -v, --verbose
           Report on the profiles as they are loaded, and show warnings.

       --warn=n
           Enable  various  warnings during policy compilation. A single warn flag can be specified per --warn option, but
           the --warn flag can be passed multiple times.

             apparmor_parser --warn=rule-not-enforced ...

           A specific warning can be disabled by prepending no- to the flag

             apparmor_parser --warn=no-rule-not-enforced ...

           Use --help=warn to see a full list of which warn flags are supported.

       --Werror[=n]
           Convert warnings into errors during policy compilation. If the optional flag  is  not  specified  all  warnings
           become  errors.  If  the  optional flag is specified only the class of warnings specified will become errors. A
           single flag can be specified per --Werror option, but the --Werror flag can be passed multiple times.

             apparmor_parser --Werror=deprecated ...

           Use --help=warn or --help=Werror to see a full list of which warn flags are supported.

       -d, --debug
           Given once, only checks the profiles to ensure syntactic correctness.  Given twice, dumps its interpretation of
           the profile for checking.

       -D n, --dump=n
           Debug flag for dumping various structures and passes  of  policy  compilation.   A  single  dump  flag  can  be
           specified  per --dump option, but the dump flag can be passed multiple times.  Note progress flags tend to also
           imply the matching stats flag.

             apparmor_parser --dump=dfa-stats --dump=trans-stats <file>

           Use --help=dump to see a full list of which dump flags are supported

       -j n, --jobs=n
           Set the number of jobs used to compile the specified policy. Where n can be

             0    - disable jobs and use the main process for all compilation
             #    - a specific number of jobs
             auto - the # of cpus in the in the system
             x#   - # * number of cpus

           Eg.
             -j8     OR --jobs=8                   allows for 8 parallel jobs
             -jauto  OR --jobs=auto                sets the jobs to the # of cpus
             -jx4    OR --jobs=x4                  sets the jobs to # of cpus * 4
             -jx1   is equivalent to   -jauto

           The default value is the number of cpus in the system. Note that if jobs  is  a  positive  integer  number  the
           --jobs-max parameter is automatically set to the same value.

       --max-jobs n
           When  --jobs  is  set  to  a  scaling  value  (ie.  auto or xN) the specify a hard cap on the value that can be
           specified by the --jobs flag.  It takes the same set of options available to the --jobs option, and defaults to
           8*cpus

       -O n, --optimize=n
           Set the optimization flags used by policy compilation.  A single  optimization  flag  can  be  toggled  per  -O
           option,  but  the  optimize flag can be passed multiple times.  Turning off some phases of the optimization can
           make it so that policy can't complete compilation due to size constraints (it is entirely possible to create  a
           dfa with millions of states that will take days or longer to compile).

           Note:  The parser is set to use a balanced default set of flags, that will result in reasonable compression but
           not take excessive amounts of time to complete.

           Use --help=optimize to see a full list of which optimization flags are supported.

       --abort-on-error Abort processing of profiles on the first error encountered, otherwise the parser will continue to
       try to compile other profiles if specified.
           Note: If an error is encountered while processing profiles the last error encountered will be used to  set  the
           exit code.

       --skip-bad-cache-rebuild The default behavior of the parser is to check if a cached version of a profile exists and
       if it does it attempt to load it into the kernel. If that load is rejected, then the parser will attempt to rebuild
       the cache file, and load again.
           This  option  tells  the parser to not attempt to rebuild the cache on failure, instead the parser continues on
           with processing the remaining profiles.

       --estimated-compile-size Adjust the internal parameter used to estimate how agressive the parser can be when
       compiling policy. This may include changes to how or when caches are dropped or how many compile units (jobs) are
       launched. The value should slightly larger than the largest Resident Set Size (RSS) encountered for the type of
       policy being compiled.
           A value that is too small may result in the parser exhausting system resources when compiling large  policy.  A
           value too large may slow policy compiles down.

           The value specified may include a suffix of KB, MB, GB, to make it easier to adjust the size.

           Note: config-file and command line options will override values chosen by tuning affected by the option.

       --config-file
           Specify the config file to use instead of /etc/apparmor/parser.conf. This option will be processed early before
           regular options regardless of the order it is specified in.

       --print-config-file
           Print the config file location that will be used.

CONFIG FILE
       An  optional config file /etc/apparmor/parser.conf can be used to specify the default options for the parser, which
       then can be overridden using the command line options.

       The config file ignores leading whitespace and treats lines that begin with #  as  comments.   Config  options  are
       specified one per line using the same format as the longform command line options (without the preceding --).

       Eg.
           #comment

           optimize=no-expr-tree
           optimize=compress-fast

       As  with  the  command line some options accumulate and others override, ie. when there are conflicting versions of
       switch the last option is the one chosen.

       Eg.
           Optimize=no-minimize
           Optimize=minimize

       would result in Optimize=minimize being set.

       The Include, Dump, and Optimize options accululate except for the inversion option  (no-X  vs.  X),  and  a  couple
       options that work by setting/clearing multiple options (compress-small).  In that case the option will override the
       flags it sets but will may accumulate with others.

       All other options override previously set values.

NAME
       apt-extracttemplates - Utility to extract debconf config and templates from Debian packages

SYNOPSIS

       apt-extracttemplates [-t=temporary_directory] filename... {-v | --version} {-h | --help}

DESCRIPTION
       apt-extracttemplates will take one or more Debian package files as input and write out (to a temporary directory)
       all associated config scripts and template files. For each passed in package that contains config scripts and
       templates, one line of output will be generated in the format:

       package version template-file config-script

       template-file and config-script are written to the temporary directory specified by the -t or --tempdir
       (APT::ExtractTemplates::TempDir) directory, with filenames of the form package.template.XXXXXX and
       package.config.XXXXXX

OPTIONS
       All command line options may be set using the configuration file, the descriptions indicate the configuration
       option to set. For boolean options you can override the config file by using something like -f-,--no-f, -f=no or
       several other variations.

       -t, --tempdir
           Temporary directory in which to write extracted debconf template files and config scripts. Configuration Item:
           APT::ExtractTemplates::TempDir

       -h, --help
           Show a short usage summary.

       -v, --version
           Show the program version.

       -c, --config-file
           Configuration File; Specify a configuration file to use. The program will read the default configuration file
           and then this configuration file. If configuration settings need to be set before the default configuration
           files are parsed specify a file with the APT_CONFIG environment variable. See apt.conf(5) for syntax
           information.

       -o, --option
           Set a Configuration Option; This will set an arbitrary configuration option. The syntax is -o Foo::Bar=bar.  -o
           and --option can be used multiple times to set different options.

SYNOPSIS
       aa-remove-unknown [option]

DESCRIPTION
       aa-remove-unknown will inventory all profiles in /etc/apparmor.d/, compare that list to the profiles currently
       loaded into the kernel, and then remove all of the loaded profiles that were not found in /etc/apparmor.d/. It will
       also report the name of each profile that it removes on standard out.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
           displays a short usage statement.

       -n  dry run; only prints the names of profiles that would be removed

EXAMPLES
         $ sudo ./aa-remove-unknown -n
         Would remove 'test//null-/usr/bin/whoami'
         Would remove 'test'

NAME
       aa-status - display various information about the current AppArmor policy.

SYNOPSIS
       aa-status [option]

DESCRIPTION
       aa-status will report various aspects of the current state of AppArmor confinement. By default, it displays the
       same information as if the --verbose argument were given. A sample of what this looks like is:

         apparmor module is loaded.
         110 profiles are loaded.
         102 profiles are in enforce mode.
         8 profiles are in complain mode.
         Out of 129 processes running:
         13 processes have profiles defined.
         8 processes have profiles in enforce mode.
         5 processes have profiles in complain mode.

       Other argument options are provided to report individual aspects, to support being used in scripts.

OPTIONS
       aa-status accepts only one argument at a time out of:

       --enabled
           returns error code if AppArmor is not enabled.

       --profiled
           displays the number of loaded AppArmor policies.

       --enforced
           displays the number of loaded enforcing AppArmor policies.

       --complaining
           displays the number of loaded non-enforcing AppArmor policies.

       --kill
           displays the number of loaded enforcing AppArmor policies that will kill tasks on policy violations.

       --prompt
           displays the number of loaded enforcing AppArmor policies, with fallback to userspace mediation.

       --special-unconfined
           displays the number of loaded non-enforcing AppArmor policies that are in the special unconfined mode.

       --process-mixed displays the number of processes confined by profile stacks with profiles in different modes.
       --verbose
           displays multiple data points about loaded AppArmor policy set (the default action if no arguments are given).

       --json
           displays multiple data points about loaded AppArmor policy set in a JSON format, fit for machine consumption.

       --pretty-json
           same as --json, formatted to be readable by humans as well as by machines.

       --show
           what  data  sets to show information about. Currently processes, profiles, all for both processes and profiles.
           The default is all.

       --count
           display only counts for selected information.

       --filter.mode=filter
           Allows specifying a posix regular expression filter that will be applied against the displayed  processess  and
           profiles apparmor profile mode, reducing the output.

       --filter.profiles=filter
           Allows  specifying  a posix regular expression filter that will be applied against the displayed processess and
           profiles confining profile, reducing the output.

       --filter.pid=filter
           Allows specifying a posix regular expression filter that will be applied against the  displayed  processes,  so
           that only processes pids matching the expression will be displayed.

       --filter.exe=filter
           Allows  specifying  a  posix regular expression filter that will be applied against the displayed processes, so
           that only processes executable name matching the expression will be displayed.

       --help
           displays a short usage statement.

EXIT STATUS
       Upon exiting, aa-status will set its exit status to the following values:

       0   if apparmor is enabled and policy is loaded.

       1   if apparmor is not enabled/loaded.

       2   if apparmor is enabled but no policy is loaded.

       3   if the apparmor control files aren't available under /sys/kernel/security/.

       4   if the user running the script doesn't have enough privileges to read the apparmor control files.

       42  if an internal error occurred.

BUGS
       aa-status must be run as root to read the state of the loaded policy from the apparmor module. It  uses  the  /proc
       filesystem to determine which processes are confined and so is susceptible to race conditions.

NAME
       apt-ftparchive - Utility to generate index files

SYNOPSIS

       apt-ftparchive [-dsq] [--md5] [--delink] [--readonly] [--contents] [--arch architecture] [-o=config_string]
                      [-c=config_file] {packages path [override-file [pathprefix]]  |
                      sources path [override-file [pathprefix]]  | contents path  | release path  |
                      generate config_file section...  | clean config_file  | {-v | --version} | {-h | --help}}

DESCRIPTION
       apt-ftparchive is the command line tool that generates the index files that APT uses to access a distribution
       source. The index files should be generated on the origin site based on the content of that site.

       apt-ftparchive is a superset of the dpkg-scanpackages(1) program, incorporating its entire functionality via the
       packages command. It also contains a contents file generator, contents, and an elaborate means to 'script' the
       generation process for a complete archive.

       Internally apt-ftparchive can make use of binary databases to cache the contents of a .deb file and it does not
       rely on any external programs aside from gzip(1). When doing a full generate it automatically performs file-change
       checks and builds the desired compressed output files.

       Unless the -h, or --help option is given, one of the commands below must be present.

       packages
           The packages command generates a package file from a directory tree. It takes the given directory and
           recursively searches it for .deb files, emitting a package record to stdout for each. This command is
           approximately equivalent to dpkg-scanpackages(1).

           The option --db can be used to specify a binary caching DB.

       sources
           The sources command generates a source index file from a directory tree. It takes the given directory and
           recursively searches it for .dsc files, emitting a source record to stdout for each. This command is
           approximately equivalent to dpkg-scansources(1).

           If an override file is specified then a source override file will be looked for with an extension of .src. The
           --source-override option can be used to change the source override file that will be used.

       contents
           The contents command generates a contents file from a directory tree. It takes the given directory and
           recursively searches it for .deb files, and reads the file list from each file. It then sorts and writes to
           stdout the list of files matched to packages. Directories are not written to the output. If multiple packages
           own the same file then each package is separated by a comma in the output.

           The option --db can be used to specify a binary caching DB.

       release
           The release command generates a Release file from a directory tree. It recursively searches the given directory
           for uncompressed and compressed Packages, Sources, Contents, Components and icons files as well as Release,
           Index and md5sum.txt files by default (APT::FTPArchive::Release::Default-Patterns). Additional filename
           patterns can be added by listing them in APT::FTPArchive::Release::Patterns. It then writes to stdout a Release
           file containing (by default) an MD5, SHA1, SHA256 and SHA512 digest for each file.

           Values for the additional metadata fields in the Release file are taken from the corresponding variables under
           APT::FTPArchive::Release, e.g.  APT::FTPArchive::Release::Origin. The supported fields are Origin, Label,
           Suite, Version, Codename, Date, NotAutomatic, ButAutomaticUpgrades, Acquire-By-Hash, Valid-Until, Signed-By,
           Architectures, Components and Description.

       generate
           The generate command is designed to be runnable from a cron script and builds indexes according to the given
           config file. The config language provides a flexible means of specifying which index files are built from which
           directories, as well as providing a simple means of maintaining the required settings.

       clean
           The clean command tidies the databases used by the given configuration file by removing any records that are no
           longer necessary.

THE GENERATE CONFIGURATION
       The generate command uses a configuration file to describe the archives that are going to be generated. It follows
       the typical ISC configuration format as seen in ISC tools like bind 8 and dhcpd.  apt.conf(5) contains a
       description of the syntax. Note that the generate configuration is parsed in sectional manner, but apt.conf(5) is
       parsed in a tree manner. This only effects how the scope tag is handled.

       The generate configuration has four separate sections, each described below.

   Dir Section
       The Dir section defines the standard directories needed to locate the files required during the generation process.
       These directories are prepended certain relative paths defined in later sections to produce a complete an absolute
       path.

       ArchiveDir
           Specifies the root of the FTP archive, in a standard Debian configuration this is the directory that contains
           the ls-LR and dist nodes.

       OverrideDir
           Specifies the location of the override files.

       CacheDir
           Specifies the location of the cache files.

       FileListDir
           Specifies the location of the file list files, if the FileList setting is used below.

   Default Section
       The Default section specifies default values, and settings that control the operation of the generator. Other
       sections may override these defaults with a per-section setting.

       Packages::Compress
           Sets the default compression schemes to use for the package index files. It is a string that contains a space
           separated list of at least one of the compressors configured via the APT::Compressor configuration scope. The
           default for all compression schemes is '. gzip'.

       Packages::Extensions
           Sets the default list of file extensions that are package files. This defaults to '.deb'.

       Sources::Compress
           This is similar to Packages::Compress except that it controls the compression for the Sources files.

       Sources::Extensions
           Sets the default list of file extensions that are source files. This defaults to '.dsc'.

       Contents::Compress
           This is similar to Packages::Compress except that it controls the compression for the Contents files.

       Translation::Compress
           This is similar to Packages::Compress except that it controls the compression for the Translation-en master
           file.

       DeLinkLimit
           Specifies the number of kilobytes to delink (and replace with hard links) per run. This is used in conjunction
           with the per-section External-Links setting.

       FileMode
           Specifies the mode of all created index files. It defaults to 0644. All index files are set to this mode with
           no regard to the umask.

       LongDescription
           Specifies whether long descriptions should be included in the Packages file or split out into a master
           Translation-en file.

   TreeDefault Section
       Sets defaults specific to Tree sections. All of these variables are substitution variables and have the strings
       $(DIST), $(SECTION) and $(ARCH) replaced with their respective values.

       MaxContentsChange
           Sets the number of kilobytes of contents files that are generated each day. The contents files are
           round-robined so that over several days they will all be rebuilt.

       ContentsAge
           Controls the number of days a contents file is allowed to be checked without changing. If this limit is passed
           the mtime of the contents file is updated. This case can occur if the package file is changed in such a way
           that does not result in a new contents file [override edit for instance]. A hold off is allowed in hopes that
           new .debs will be installed, requiring a new file anyhow. The default is 10, the units are in days.

       Directory
           Sets the top of the .deb directory tree. Defaults to $(DIST)/$(SECTION)/binary-$(ARCH)/

       SrcDirectory
           Sets the top of the source package directory tree. Defaults to $(DIST)/$(SECTION)/source/

       Packages
           Sets the output Packages file. Defaults to $(DIST)/$(SECTION)/binary-$(ARCH)/Packages

       Sources
           Sets the output Sources file. Defaults to $(DIST)/$(SECTION)/source/Sources

       Translation
           Sets the output Translation-en master file with the long descriptions if they should be not included in the
           Packages file. Defaults to $(DIST)/$(SECTION)/i18n/Translation-en

       InternalPrefix
           Sets the path prefix that causes a symlink to be considered an internal link instead of an external link.
           Defaults to $(DIST)/$(SECTION)/

       Contents
           Sets the output Contents file. Defaults to $(DIST)/$(SECTION)/Contents-$(ARCH). If this setting causes multiple
           Packages files to map onto a single Contents file (as is the default) then apt-ftparchive will integrate those
           package files together automatically.

       Contents::Header
           Sets header file to prepend to the contents output.

       BinCacheDB
           Sets the binary cache database to use for this section. Multiple sections can share the same database.

       FileList
           Specifies that instead of walking the directory tree, apt-ftparchive should read the list of files from the
           given file. Relative files names are prefixed with the archive directory.

       SourceFileList
           Specifies that instead of walking the directory tree, apt-ftparchive should read the list of files from the
           given file. Relative files names are prefixed with the archive directory. This is used when processing source
           indexes.

   Tree Section
       The Tree section defines a standard Debian file tree which consists of a base directory, then multiple sections in
       that base directory and finally multiple Architectures in each section. The exact pathing used is defined by the
       Directory substitution variable.

       The Tree section takes a scope tag which sets the $(DIST) variable and defines the root of the tree (the path is
       prefixed by ArchiveDir). Typically this is a setting such as dists/bookworm.

       All of the settings defined in the TreeDefault section can be used in a Tree section as well as three new
       variables.

       When processing a Tree section apt-ftparchive performs an operation similar to:

           for i in Sections do
              for j in Architectures do
                 Generate for DIST=scope SECTION=i ARCH=j

       Sections
           This is a space separated list of sections which appear under the distribution; typically this is something
           like main contrib non-free non-free-firmware

       Architectures
           This is a space separated list of all the architectures that appear under search section. The special
           architecture 'source' is used to indicate that this tree has a source archive. The architecture 'all' signals
           that architecture specific files like Packages should not include information about architecture all packages
           in all files as they will be available in a dedicated file.

       LongDescription
           Specifies whether long descriptions should be included in the Packages file or split out into a master
           Translation-en file.

       BinOverride
           Sets the binary override file. The override file contains section, priority and maintainer address information.

       SrcOverride
           Sets the source override file. The override file contains section information.

       ExtraOverride
           Sets the binary extra override file.

       SrcExtraOverride
           Sets the source extra override file.

   BinDirectory Section
       The bindirectory section defines a binary directory tree with no special structure. The scope tag specifies the
       location of the binary directory and the settings are similar to the Tree section with no substitution variables or
       SectionArchitecture settings.

       Packages
           Sets the Packages file output.

       Sources
           Sets the Sources file output. At least one of Packages or Sources is required.

       Contents
           Sets the Contents file output (optional).

       BinOverride
           Sets the binary override file.

       SrcOverride
           Sets the source override file.

       ExtraOverride
           Sets the binary extra override file.

       SrcExtraOverride
           Sets the source extra override file.

       BinCacheDB
           Sets the cache DB.

       PathPrefix
           Appends a path to all the output paths.

       FileList, SourceFileList
           Specifies the file list file.

THE BINARY OVERRIDE FILE
       The binary override file is fully compatible with dpkg-scanpackages(1). It contains four fields separated by
       spaces. The first field is the package name, the second is the priority to force that package to, the third is the
       section to force that package to and the final field is the maintainer permutation field.

       The general form of the maintainer field is:

           old [// oldn]* => new

       or simply,

           new

       The first form allows a double-slash separated list of old email addresses to be specified. If any of those are
       found then new is substituted for the maintainer field. The second form unconditionally substitutes the maintainer
       field.

THE SOURCE OVERRIDE FILE
       The source override file is fully compatible with dpkg-scansources(1). It contains two fields separated by spaces.
       The first field is the source package name, the second is the section to assign it.

THE EXTRA OVERRIDE FILE
       The extra override file allows any arbitrary tag to be added or replaced in the output. It has three columns, the
       first is the package, the second is the tag and the remainder of the line is the new value.

OPTIONS
       All command line options may be set using the configuration file, the descriptions indicate the configuration
       option to set. For boolean options you can override the config file by using something like -f-,--no-f, -f=no or
       several other variations.

       --md5, --sha1, --sha256, --sha512
           Generate the given checksum. These options default to on, when turned off the generated index files will not
           have the checksum fields where possible. Configuration Items: APT::FTPArchive::Checksum and
           APT::FTPArchive::Index::Checksum where Index can be Packages, Sources or Release and Checksum can be MD5, SHA1,
           SHA256 or SHA512.

       -d, --db
           Use a binary caching DB. This has no effect on the generate command. Configuration Item: APT::FTPArchive::DB.

       -q, --quiet
           Quiet; produces output suitable for logging, omitting progress indicators. More q's will produce more quiet up
           to a maximum of 2. You can also use -q=# to set the quiet level, overriding the configuration file.
           Configuration Item: quiet.

       --delink
           Perform Delinking. If the External-Links setting is used then this option actually enables delinking of the
           files. It defaults to on and can be turned off with --no-delink. Configuration Item:
           APT::FTPArchive::DeLinkAct.

       --contents
           Perform contents generation. When this option is set and package indexes are being generated with a cache DB
           then the file listing will also be extracted and stored in the DB for later use. When using the generate
           command this option also allows the creation of any Contents files. The default is on. Configuration Item:
           APT::FTPArchive::Contents.

       -s, --source-override
           Select the source override file to use with the sources command. Configuration Item:
           APT::FTPArchive::SourceOverride.

       --readonly
           Make the caching databases read only. Configuration Item: APT::FTPArchive::ReadOnlyDB.

       -a, --arch
           Accept in the packages and contents commands only package files matching *_arch.deb or *_all.deb instead of all
           package files in the given path. Configuration Item: APT::FTPArchive::Architecture.

       APT::FTPArchive::AlwaysStat
           apt-ftparchive(1) caches as much as possible of metadata in a cachedb. If packages are recompiled and/or
           republished with the same version again, this will lead to problems as the now outdated cached metadata like
           size and checksums will be used. With this option enabled this will no longer happen as it will be checked if
           the file was changed. Note that this option is set to "false" by default as it is not recommend to upload
           multiple versions/builds of a package with the same version number, so in theory nobody will have these
           problems and therefore all these extra checks are useless.

       APT::FTPArchive::LongDescription
           This configuration option defaults to "true" and should only be set to "false" if the Archive generated with
           apt-ftparchive(1) also provides Translation files. Note that the Translation-en master file can only be created
           in the generate command.

       -h, --help
           Show a short usage summary.

       -v, --version
           Show the program version.

       -c, --config-file
           Configuration File; Specify a configuration file to use. The program will read the default configuration file
           and then this configuration file. If configuration settings need to be set before the default configuration
           files are parsed specify a file with the APT_CONFIG environment variable. See apt.conf(5) for syntax
           information.

       -o, --option
           Set a Configuration Option; This will set an arbitrary configuration option. The syntax is -o Foo::Bar=bar.  -o
           and --option can be used multiple times to set different options.

EXAMPLES
       To create a compressed Packages file for a directory containing binary packages (.deb):

           apt-ftparchive packages directory | gzip > Packages.gz

DESCRIPTION
       GNU as is really a family of assemblers.  If you use (or have used) the GNU assembler on one architecture, you
       should find a fairly similar environment when you use it on another architecture.  Each version has much in common
       with the others, including object file formats, most assembler directives (often called pseudo-ops) and assembler
       syntax.

       as is primarily intended to assemble the output of the GNU C compiler "gcc" for use by the linker "ld".
       Nevertheless, we've tried to make as assemble correctly everything that other assemblers for the same machine would
       assemble.  Any exceptions are documented explicitly.  This doesn't mean as always uses the same syntax as another
       assembler for the same architecture; for example, we know of several incompatible versions of 680x0 assembly
       language syntax.

       Each time you run as it assembles exactly one source program.  The source program is made up of one or more files.
       (The standard input is also a file.)

       You give as a command line that has zero or more input file names.  The input files are read (from left file name
       to right).  A command-line argument (in any position) that has no special meaning is taken to be an input file
       name.

       If you give as no file names it attempts to read one input file from the as standard input, which is normally your
       terminal.  You may have to type ctl-D to tell as there is no more program to assemble.

       Use -- if you need to explicitly name the standard input file in your command line.

       If the source is empty, as produces a small, empty object file.

       as may write warnings and error messages to the standard error file (usually your terminal).  This should not
       happen when  a compiler runs as automatically.  Warnings report an assumption made so that as could keep assembling
       a flawed program; errors report a grave problem that stops the assembly.

       If you are invoking as via the GNU C compiler, you can use the -Wa option to pass arguments through to the
       assembler.  The assembler arguments must be separated from each other (and the -Wa) by commas.  For example:

               gcc -c -g -O -Wa,-alh,-L file.c

       This passes two options to the assembler: -alh (emit a listing to standard output with high-level and assembly
       source) and -L (retain local symbols in the symbol table).

       Usually you do not need to use this -Wa mechanism, since many compiler command-line options are automatically
       passed to the assembler by the compiler.  (You can call the GNU compiler driver with the -v option to see precisely
       what options it passes to each compilation pass, including the assembler.)

OPTIONS
       @file
           Read  command-line options from file.  The options read are inserted in place of the original @file option.  If
           file does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated literally, and not removed.

           Options in file are separated by  whitespace.   A  whitespace  character  may  be  included  in  an  option  by
           surrounding  the entire option in either single or double quotes.  Any character (including a backslash) may be
           included by prefixing the character to be included with a backslash.  The file may  itself  contain  additional
           @file options; any such options will be processed recursively.

       -a[cdghilmns]
           Turn on listings, in any of a variety of ways:

           -ac omit false conditionals

           -ad omit debugging directives

           -ag include general information, like as version and options passed

           -ah include high-level source

           -al include assembly

           -ali
               include assembly with ginsn

           -am include macro expansions

           -an omit forms processing

           -as include symbols

           =file
               set the name of the listing file

           You  may combine these options; for example, use -aln for assembly listing without forms processing.  The =file
           option, if used, must be the last one.  By itself, -a defaults to -ahls.

       --alternate
           Begin in alternate macro mode.

       --compress-debug-sections
           Compress DWARF debug sections using zlib with SHF_COMPRESSED from the ELF ABI.  The resulting object  file  may
           not be compatible with older linkers and object file utilities.  Note if compression would make a given section
           larger then it is not compressed.

       --compress-debug-sections=none
       --compress-debug-sections=zlib
       --compress-debug-sections=zlib-gnu
       --compress-debug-sections=zlib-gabi
       --compress-debug-sections=zstd
           These options control how DWARF debug sections are compressed.  --compress-debug-sections=none is equivalent to
           --nocompress-debug-sections.    --compress-debug-sections=zlib   and   --compress-debug-sections=zlib-gabi  are
           equivalent to --compress-debug-sections.  --compress-debug-sections=zlib-gnu compresses  DWARF  debug  sections
           using   the   obsoleted   zlib-gnu   format.    The   debug   sections  are  renamed  to  begin  with  .zdebug.
           --compress-debug-sections=zstd compresses DWARF debug  sections  using  zstd.   Note  -  if  compression  would
           actually make a section larger, then it is not compressed nor renamed.

       --nocompress-debug-sections
           Do not compress DWARF debug sections.  This is usually the default for all targets except the x86/x86_64, but a
           configure time option can be used to override this.

       -D  Enable  debugging  in target specific backends, if supported.  Otherwise ignored.  Even if ignored, this option
           is accepted for script compatibility with calls to other assemblers.

       --debug-prefix-map old=new
           When assembling files in directory old, record debugging information describing them as in new instead.

       --defsym sym=value
           Define the symbol sym to be value before assembling the input file.  value must be an integer constant.  As  in
           C,  a  leading  0x  indicates  a hexadecimal value, and a leading 0 indicates an octal value.  The value of the
           symbol can be overridden inside a source file via the use of a ".set" pseudo-op.

       --dump-config
           Displays how the assembler is configured and then exits.

       --elf-stt-common=no
       --elf-stt-common=yes
           These options control whether the ELF assembler should generate common symbols with the "STT_COMMON" type.  The
           default can be controlled by a configure option --enable-elf-stt-common.

       --emulation=name
           If the assembler is configured to support multiple different target configurations then this option can be used
           to select the desired form.

       -f  "fast"---skip whitespace and comment preprocessing (assume source is compiler output).

       -g
       --gen-debug
           Generate debugging information for each assembler source line using whichever debug format is preferred by  the
           target.   This  currently  means  either  STABS,  ECOFF  or  DWARF2.   When  the  debug  format is DWARF then a
           ".debug_info" and ".debug_line" section is only emitted when the assembly file doesn't generate one itself.

       --gstabs
           Generate stabs debugging information for each assembler line.  This may help debugging assembler code,  if  the
           debugger can handle it.

       --gstabs+
           Generate  stabs  debugging  information for each assembler line, with GNU extensions that probably only gdb can
           handle, and that could make other debuggers crash or refuse to read your  program.   This  may  help  debugging
           assembler  code.   Currently  the  only  GNU  extension  is  the  location  of the current working directory at
           assembling time.

       --gdwarf-2
           Generate DWARF2 debugging information for each assembler line.  This may help debugging assembler code, if  the
           debugger can handle it.  Note---this option is only supported by some targets, not all of them.

       --gdwarf-3
           This  option  is the same as the --gdwarf-2 option, except that it allows for the possibility of the generation
           of extra debug information as per version 3 of the DWARF specification.  Note - enabling this option  does  not
           guarantee the generation of any extra information, the choice to do so is on a per target basis.

       --gdwarf-4
           This  option  is the same as the --gdwarf-2 option, except that it allows for the possibility of the generation
           of extra debug information as per version 4 of the DWARF specification.  Note - enabling this option  does  not
           guarantee the generation of any extra information, the choice to do so is on a per target basis.

       --gdwarf-5
           This  option  is the same as the --gdwarf-2 option, except that it allows for the possibility of the generation
           of extra debug information as per version 5 of the DWARF specification.  Note - enabling this option  does  not
           guarantee the generation of any extra information, the choice to do so is on a per target basis.

       --gdwarf-sections
           Instead of creating a .debug_line section, create a series of .debug_line.foo sections where foo is the name of
           the  corresponding  code section.  For example a code section called .text.func will have its dwarf line number
           information placed into a section called .debug_line.text.func.  If the code section is just called .text  then
           debug line section will still be called just .debug_line without any suffix.

       --gdwarf-cie-version=version
           Control which version of DWARF Common Information Entries (CIEs) are produced.  When this flag is not specified
           the default is version 1, though some targets can modify this default.  Other possible values for version are 3
           or 4.

       --generate-missing-build-notes=yes
       --generate-missing-build-notes=no
           These  options  control whether the ELF assembler should generate GNU Build attribute notes if none are present
           in the input sources.  The default can be controlled by the --enable-generate-build-notes configure option.

       --gsframe
       --gsframe
           Create .sframe section from CFI directives.

       --hash-size N
           Ignored.  Supported for command line compatibility with other assemblers.

       --help
           Print a summary of the command-line options and exit.

       --target-help
           Print a summary of all target specific options and exit.

       -I dir
           Add directory dir to the search list for ".include" directives.

       -J  Don't warn about signed overflow.

       -K  Issue warnings when difference tables altered for long displacements.

       -L
       --keep-locals
           Keep (in the symbol table) local symbols.  These symbols  start  with  system-specific  local  label  prefixes,
           typically .L for ELF systems or L for traditional a.out systems.

       --listing-lhs-width=number
           Set the maximum width, in words, of the output data column for an assembler listing to number.

       --listing-lhs-width2=number
           Set  the  maximum  width, in words, of the output data column for continuation lines in an assembler listing to
           number.

       --listing-rhs-width=number
           Set the maximum width of an input source line, as displayed in a listing, to number bytes.

       --listing-cont-lines=number
           Set the maximum number of lines printed in a listing for a single line of input to number + 1.

       --multibyte-handling=allow
       --multibyte-handling=warn
       --multibyte-handling=warn-sym-only
       --multibyte-handling=warn_sym_only
           Controls how the assembler handles multibyte characters in the input.  The default (which can  be  restored  by
           using the allow argument) is to allow such characters without complaint.  Using the warn argument will make the
           assembler  generate a warning message whenever any multibyte character is encountered.  Using the warn-sym-only
           argument will only cause a warning to be generated when a symbol is defined with a name that contains multibyte
           characters.  (References to undefined symbols will not generate a warning).

       --no-pad-sections
           Stop the assembler for padding the ends of output sections to the alignment of that section.  The default is to
           pad the sections, but this can  waste  space  which  might  be  needed  on  targets  which  have  tight  memory
           constraints.

       -o objfile
           Name the object-file output from as objfile.

       -R  Fold the data section into the text section.

       --reduce-memory-overheads
           Ignored.   Supported  for  compatibility  with  tools  that  apss the same option to both the assembler and the
           linker.

       --scfi=experimental
           This option controls whether the assembler should synthesize CFI for hand-written input.  If the input  already
           contains  some  synthesizable  CFI  directives,  the  assembler  ignores  them  and emits a warning.  Note that
           "--scfi=experimental" is not intended to be used for compiler-generated code, including inline assembly.   This
           experimental support is work in progress.  Only System V AMD64 ABI is supported.

           Each input function in assembly must begin with the ".type" directive, and should ideally be closed off using a
           ".size"  directive.   When  using SCFI, each ".type" directive prompts GAS to start a new FDE (a.k.a., Function
           Descriptor Entry).  This implies that with each ".type" directive, a previous block of instructions, if any, is
           finalised as a distinct FDE.

       --sectname-subst
           Honor substitution sequences in section names.

       --size-check=error
       --size-check=warning
           Issue an error or warning for invalid ELF .size directive.

       --statistics
           Print the maximum space (in bytes) and total time (in seconds) used by assembly.

       --strip-local-absolute
           Remove local absolute symbols from the outgoing symbol table.

       -v
       -version
           Print the as version.

       --version
           Print the as version and exit.

       -W
       --no-warn
           Suppress warning messages.

       --fatal-warnings
           Treat warnings as errors.

       --warn
           Don't suppress warning messages or treat them as errors.

       -w  Ignored.

       -x  Ignored.

       -Z  Generate an object file even after errors.

       -- | files ...
           Standard input, or source files to assemble.

       The following options are available when as is configured for the 64-bit mode of the ARM Architecture (AArch64).

       -EB This option specifies that the output generated by the assembler should be marked as being encoded for  a  big-
           endian processor.

       -EL This  option  specifies  that  the  output  generated  by the assembler should be marked as being encoded for a
           little-endian processor.

       -mabi=abi
           Specify which ABI the source code uses.  The recognized arguments are: "ilp32" and "lp64",  which  decides  the
           generated object file in ELF32 and ELF64 format respectively.  The default is "lp64".

       -mcpu=processor[+extension...]
           This option specifies the target processor.  The assembler will issue an error message if an attempt is made to
           assemble  an  instruction  which  will  not execute on the target processor.  The following processor names are
           recognized: "cortex-a34", "cortex-a35", "cortex-a53", "cortex-a55", "cortex-a57", "cortex-a65", "cortex-a65ae",
           "cortex-a72",   "cortex-a73",   "cortex-a75",   "cortex-a76",   "cortex-a76ae",   "cortex-a77",   "cortex-a78",
           "cortex-a78ae", "cortex-a78c", "cortex-a510", "cortex-a520", "cortex-a710", "cortex-a720", "ares", "exynos-m1",
           "falkor",   "neoverse-n1",  "neoverse-n2",  "neoverse-e1",  "neoverse-v1",  "qdf24xx",  "saphira",  "thunderx",
           "vulcan", "xgene1" "xgene2", "cortex-r82", "cortex-x1", "cortex-x2", "cortex-x3", and "cortex-x4".  The special
           name "all" may be used to allow the assembler  to  accept  instructions  valid  for  any  supported  processor,
           including all optional extensions.

           In  addition  to the basic instruction set, the assembler can be told to accept, or restrict, various extension
           mnemonics that extend the processor.

           If some implementations of a particular processor can  have  an  extension,  then  then  those  extensions  are
           automatically enabled.  Consequently, you will not normally have to specify any additional extensions.

       -march=architecture[+extension...]
           This option specifies the target architecture.  The assembler will issue an error message if an attempt is made
           to assemble an instruction which will not execute on the target architecture.  The following architecture names
           are  recognized:  "armv8-a",  "armv8.1-a",  "armv8.2-a",  "armv8.3-a",  "armv8.4-a"  "armv8.5-a",  "armv8.6-a",
           "armv8.7-a",  "armv8.8-a",  "armv8.9-a",  "armv8-r",  "armv9-a",  "armv9.1-a",  "armv9.2-a",  "armv9.3-a"   and
           "armv9.4-a".

           If  both  -mcpu  and  -march  are  specified,  the  assembler  will  use the setting for -mcpu.  If neither are
           specified, the assembler will default to -mcpu=all.

           The architecture option can be extended with the same instruction set extension options as  the  -mcpu  option.
           Unlike -mcpu, extensions are not always enabled by default.

       -mverbose-error
           This option enables verbose error messages for AArch64 gas.  This option is enabled by default.

       -mno-verbose-error
           This option disables verbose error messages in AArch64 gas.

       The following options are available when as is configured for an Alpha processor.

       -mcpu
           This  option  specifies  the target processor.  If an attempt is made to assemble an instruction which will not
           execute on the target processor, the assembler may either expand the instruction as a macro or issue  an  error
           message.  This option is equivalent to the ".arch" directive.

           The following processor names are recognized: 21064, "21064a", 21066, 21068, 21164, "21164a", "21164pc", 21264,
           "21264a",  "21264b",  "ev4",  "ev5",  "lca45", "ev5", "ev56", "pca56", "ev6", "ev67", "ev68".  The special name
           "all" may be used to allow the assembler to accept instructions valid for any Alpha processor.

           In order to support existing practice in OSF/1 with respect to ".arch", and existing practice within MILO  (the
           Linux  ARC  bootloader),  the  numbered  processor  names  (e.g.  21064)  enable the processor-specific PALcode
           instructions, while the "electro-vlasic" names (e.g. "ev4") do not.

       -mdebug
       -no-mdebug
           Enables or disables the generation of ".mdebug" encapsulation for stabs directives and  procedure  descriptors.
           The default is to automatically enable ".mdebug" when the first stabs directive is seen.

       -relax
           This  option  forces all relocations to be put into the object file, instead of saving space and resolving some
           relocations at assembly time.  Note that this option does not propagate all symbol arithmetic into  the  object
           file,  because  not  all  symbol  arithmetic  can  be  represented.  However, the option can still be useful in
           specific applications.

       -replace
       -noreplace
           Enables or disables the optimization of procedure calls, both at assemblage and at link  time.   These  options
           are  only  available  for  VMS  targets and "-replace" is the default.  See section 1.4.1 of the OpenVMS Linker
           Utility Manual.

       -g  This option is used when the compiler generates debug information.  When gcc is using  mips-tfile  to  generate
           debug information for ECOFF, local labels must be passed through to the object file.  Otherwise this option has
           no effect.

       -Gsize
           A local common symbol larger than size is placed in ".bss", while smaller symbols are placed in ".sbss".

       -F
       -32addr
           These options are ignored for backward compatibility.

       The following options are available when as is configured for an ARC processor.

       -mcpu=cpu
           This option selects the core processor variant.

       -EB | -EL
           Select either big-endian (-EB) or little-endian (-EL) output.

           Enable Thumb only instruction decoding.

       -mapcs-32 | -mapcs-26 | -mapcs-float | -mapcs-reentrant
           Select which procedure calling convention is in use.

       -EB | -EL
           Select either big-endian (-EB) or little-endian (-EL) output.

       -mthumb-interwork
           Specify that the code has been generated with interworking between Thumb and ARM code in mind.

       -mccs
           Turns on CodeComposer Studio assembly syntax compatibility mode.

       -k  Specify that PIC code has been generated.

       The following options are available when as is configured for the Blackfin processor family.

       -mcpu=processor[-sirevision]
           This  option specifies the target processor.  The optional sirevision is not used in assembler.  It's here such
           that GCC can easily pass down its "-mcpu=" option.  The assembler will issue an error message if an attempt  is
           made  to assemble an instruction which will not execute on the target processor.  The following processor names
           are recognized: "bf504", "bf506", "bf512", "bf514",  "bf516",  "bf518",  "bf522",  "bf523",  "bf524",  "bf525",
           "bf526", "bf527", "bf531", "bf532", "bf533", "bf534", "bf535" (not implemented yet), "bf536", "bf537", "bf538",
           "bf539",  "bf542",  "bf542m",  "bf544",  "bf544m",  "bf547",  "bf547m",  "bf548",  "bf548m", "bf549", "bf549m",
           "bf561", and "bf592".

       -mfdpic
           Assemble for the FDPIC ABI.

       -mno-fdpic
       -mnopic
           Disable -mfdpic.

       The following options are available when as is configured for the Linux kernel BPF processor family.

       @chapter BPF Dependent Features

   BPF Options
       -EB This option specifies that the assembler should emit big-endian eBPF.

       -EL This option specifies that the assembler should emit little-endian eBPF.

       -mdialect=dialect
           This option specifies the assembly language dialect to recognize  while  assembling.   The  assembler  supports
           normal and pseudoc.

       -misa-spec=spec
           This  option  specifies  the  version  of the BPF instruction set to use when assembling.  The BPF ISA versions
           supported are v1 v2, v3 and v4.

           The value xbpf can be specified to recognize extra instructions that are used by GCC for testing purposes.  But
           beware this is not valid BPF.

       -mno-relax
           This option tells the assembler to not relax instructions.

       Note that if no endianness option is specified in the command line, the host endianness  is  used.   See  the  info
       pages for documentation of the CRIS-specific options.

       The following options are available when as is configured for the C-SKY processor family.

       -march=archname
           Assemble for architecture archname.  The --help option lists valid values for archname.

       -mcpu=cpuname
           Assemble for architecture cpuname.  The --help option lists valid values for cpuname.

       -EL
       -mlittle-endian
           Generate little-endian output.

       -EB
       -mbig-endian
           Generate big-endian output.

       -fpic
       -pic
           Generate position-independent code.

       -mljump
       -mno-ljump
           Enable/disable  transformation of the short branch instructions "jbf", "jbt", and "jbr" to "jmpi".  This option
           is for V2 processors only.  It is ignored on  CK801  and  CK802  targets,  which  do  not  support  the  "jmpi"
           instruction, and is enabled by default for other processors.

       -mbranch-stub
       -mno-branch-stub
           Pass through "R_CKCORE_PCREL_IMM26BY2" relocations for "bsr" instructions to the linker.

           This  option  is only available for bare-metal C-SKY V2 ELF targets, where it is enabled by default.  It cannot
           be used in code that will be dynamically linked against shared libraries.

       -force2bsr
       -mforce2bsr
       -no-force2bsr
       -mno-force2bsr
           Enable/disable  transformation  of  "jbsr"  instructions  to  "bsr".   This  option  is  always  enabled   (and
           -mno-force2bsr is ignored) for CK801/CK802 targets.  It is also always enabled when -mbranch-stub is in effect.

       -jsri2bsr
       -mjsri2bsr
       -no-jsri2bsr
       -mno-jsri2bsr
           Enable/disable transformation of "jsri" instructions to "bsr".  This option is enabled by default.

       -mnolrw
       -mno-lrw
           Enable/disable transformation of "lrw" instructions into a "movih"/"ori" pair.

       -melrw
       -mno-elrw
           Enable/disable extended "lrw" instructions.  This option is enabled by default for CK800-series processors.

       -mlaf
       -mliterals-after-func

       -mno-literals-after-func
           Enable/disable placement of literal pools after each function.

       -mlabr
       -mliterals-after-br
       -mno-labr
       -mnoliterals-after-br
           Enable/disable placement of literal pools after unconditional branches.  This option is enabled by default.

       -mistack
       -mno-istack
           Enable/disable  interrupt  stack  instructions.   This  option is enabled by default on CK801, CK802, and CK802
           processors.

       The following options explicitly enable certain optional instructions.  These features are also enabled  implicitly
       by using "-mcpu=" to specify a processor that supports it.

       -mhard-float
           Enable hard float instructions.

       -mmp
           Enable multiprocessor instructions.

       -mcp

       -mvdsp
           Enable vector DSP instructions.

       The following options are available when as is configured for an Epiphany processor.

       -mepiphany
           Specifies that the both 32 and 16 bit instructions are allowed.  This is the default behavior.

       -mepiphany16
           Restricts the permitted instructions to just the 16 bit set.

       The  following  options  are  available  when  as is configured for an H8/300 processor.  @chapter H8/300 Dependent
       Features

   Options
       The Renesas H8/300 version of "as" has one machine-dependent option:

       -h-tick-hex
           Support H'00 style hex constants in addition to 0x00 style.

       -mach=name
           Sets the H8300 machine variant.  The following machine names are  recognised:  "h8300h",  "h8300hn",  "h8300s",
           "h8300sn", "h8300sx" and "h8300sxn".

       The following options are available when as is configured for an i386 processor.

       --32 | --x32 | --64
           Select  the  word  size, either 32 bits or 64 bits.  --32 implies Intel i386 architecture, while --x32 and --64
           imply AMD x86-64 architecture with 32-bit or 64-bit word-size respectively.

           These options are only available with the ELF object file format, and require that the  necessary  BFD  support
           has  been  included  (on a 32-bit platform you have to add --enable-64-bit-bfd to configure enable 64-bit usage
           and use x86-64 as target platform).

       -n  By default, x86 GAS replaces multiple nop instructions used for alignment within code sections with  multi-byte
           nop  instructions  such  as  leal  0(%esi,1),%esi.   This switch disables the optimization if a single byte nop
           (0x90) is explicitly specified as the fill byte for alignment.

       --divide
           On SVR4-derived platforms, the character / is treated as a comment character, which means  that  it  cannot  be
           used  in  expressions.   The  --divide  option turns / into a normal character.  This does not disable / at the
           beginning of a line starting a comment, or affect using # for starting a comment.

       -march=CPU[+EXTENSION...]
           This option specifies the target processor.  The assembler will issue an error message if an attempt is made to
           assemble an instruction which will not execute on the target processor.   The  following  processor  names  are
           recognized:  "i8086",  "i186",  "i286",  "i386",  "i486", "i586", "i686", "pentium", "pentiumpro", "pentiumii",
           "pentiumiii", "pentium4", "prescott", "nocona", "core", "core2", "corei7",  "iamcu",  "k6",  "k6_2",  "athlon",

           "znver5", "btver1", "btver2", "generic32" and "generic64".

           In addition to the basic instruction set, the assembler can be told to accept various extension mnemonics.  For
           example, "-march=i686+sse4+vmx" extends i686 with  sse4  and  vmx.   The  following  extensions  are  currently
           supported:  8087,  287,  387,  687,  "cmov",  "fxsr", "mmx", "sse", "sse2", "sse3", "sse4a", "ssse3", "sse4.1",

           "snp",  "invlpgb",  "tlbsync",  "svme" and "padlock".  Note that these extension mnemonics can be prefixed with
           "no" to revoke the respective (and any dependent) functionality.  Note further that the suffixes  permitted  on
           "-march=avx10.<N>"  enforce a vector length restriction, i.e. despite these otherwise being "enabling" options,
           using these suffixes will disable all insns with wider vector or mask register operands.

           When the ".arch" directive is used with -march, the ".arch" directive will take precedent.

       -mtune=CPU
           This option specifies a processor to optimize for. When used  in  conjunction  with  the  -march  option,  only
           instructions of the processor specified by the -march option will be generated.

           Valid CPU values are identical to the processor list of -march=CPU.

       -msse2avx
           This option specifies that the assembler should encode SSE instructions with VEX prefix.

       -muse-unaligned-vector-move
           This option specifies that the assembler should encode aligned vector move as unaligned vector move.

       -msse-check=none
       -msse-check=warning
       -msse-check=error
           These options control if the assembler should check SSE instructions.  -msse-check=none will make the assembler
           not  to  check  SSE  instructions,   which is the default.  -msse-check=warning will make the assembler issue a
           warning for any SSE instruction.  -msse-check=error will  make  the  assembler  issue  an  error  for  any  SSE
           instruction.

       -mavxscalar=128
       -mavxscalar=256
           These  options  control  how  the assembler should encode scalar AVX instructions.  -mavxscalar=128 will encode
           scalar AVX instructions with 128bit vector length, which is the default.  -mavxscalar=256  will  encode  scalar
           AVX instructions with 256bit vector length.

           WARNING:  Don't  use  this  for  production code - due to CPU errata the resulting code may not work on certain
           models.

       -mvexwig=0
       -mvexwig=1
           These options control how the assembler should encode VEX.W-ignored (WIG) VEX  instructions.   -mvexwig=0  will
           encode WIG VEX instructions with vex.w = 0, which is the default.  -mvexwig=1 will encode WIG EVEX instructions
           with vex.w = 1.

           WARNING:  Don't  use  this  for  production code - due to CPU errata the resulting code may not work on certain
           models.

       -mevexlig=128
       -mevexlig=256
       -mevexlig=512
           These options control how the assembler should encode length-ignored (LIG)  EVEX  instructions.   -mevexlig=128
           will  encode  LIG  EVEX  instructions  with  128bit  vector  length,  which  is the default.  -mevexlig=256 and
           -mevexlig=512 will encode LIG EVEX instructions with 256bit and 512bit vector length, respectively.

       -mevexwig=0
       -mevexwig=1
           These options control how the assembler should encode w-ignored  (WIG)  EVEX  instructions.   -mevexwig=0  will
           encode  WIG  EVEX  instructions  with  evex.w  =  0,  which  is  the default.  -mevexwig=1 will encode WIG EVEX
           instructions with evex.w = 1.

       -mmnemonic=att
       -mmnemonic=intel
           This  option  specifies  instruction   mnemonic   for   matching   instructions.    The   ".att_mnemonic"   and
           ".intel_mnemonic" directives will take precedent.

       -msyntax=att
       -msyntax=intel
           This  option  specifies instruction syntax when processing instructions.  The ".att_syntax" and ".intel_syntax"
           directives will take precedent.

       -mnaked-reg
           This option specifies that  registers  don't  require  a  %  prefix.   The  ".att_syntax"  and  ".intel_syntax"
           directives will take precedent.

       -madd-bnd-prefix
           This  option  forces  the  assembler  to add BND prefix to all branches, even if such prefix was not explicitly
           specified in the source code.

       -mno-shared
           On ELF target, the assembler normally optimizes out non-PLT relocations against defined non-weak global  branch
           targets  with default visibility.  The -mshared option tells the assembler to generate code which may go into a
           shared library where all non-weak global  branch  targets  with  default  visibility  can  be  preempted.   The
           resulting code is slightly bigger.  This option only affects the handling of branch instructions.

       -mbig-obj
           On PE/COFF target this option forces the use of big object file format, which allows more than 32768 sections.

       -momit-lock-prefix=no
       -momit-lock-prefix=yes
           These options control how the assembler should encode lock prefix.  This option is intended as a workaround for
           processors,  that  fail  on  lock  prefix.  This option can only be safely used with single-core, single-thread
           computers -momit-lock-prefix=yes will omit all lock prefixes.  -momit-lock-prefix=no will encode lock prefix as
           usual, which is the default.

       -mfence-as-lock-add=no
       -mfence-as-lock-add=yes
           These options control how the assembler should encode lfence, mfence and sfence.  -mfence-as-lock-add=yes  will
           encode  lfence, mfence and sfence as lock addl $0x0, (%rsp) in 64-bit mode and lock addl $0x0, (%esp) in 32-bit
           mode.  -mfence-as-lock-add=no will encode lfence, mfence and sfence as usual, which is the default.

       -mrelax-relocations=no
       -mrelax-relocations=yes
           These options control whether the assembler should generate relax relocations, R_386_GOT32X, in 32-bit mode, or
           R_X86_64_GOTPCRELX and R_X86_64_REX_GOTPCRELX, in 64-bit mode.   -mrelax-relocations=yes  will  generate  relax
           relocations.   -mrelax-relocations=no  will not generate relax relocations.  The default can be controlled by a
           configure option --enable-x86-relax-relocations.

       -malign-branch-boundary=NUM
           This option controls how the assembler should align branches with segment prefixes or NOP.  NUM must be a power
           of  2.   It  should  be  0  or  no  less  than  16.   Branches  will  be  aligned  within  NUM  byte  boundary.
           -malign-branch-boundary=0, which is the default, doesn't align branches.

       -malign-branch=TYPE[+TYPE...]
           This  option  specifies types of branches to align. TYPE is combination of jcc, which aligns conditional jumps,
           fused, which aligns fused conditional jumps, jmp, which aligns unconditional jumps, call  which  aligns  calls,
           ret,   which   aligns   rets,   indirect,   which   aligns   indirect   jumps   and   calls.   The  default  is
           -malign-branch=jcc+fused+jmp.

       -malign-branch-prefix-size=NUM
           This option specifies the maximum number of prefixes on an  instruction  to  align  branches.   NUM  should  be
           between 0 and 5.  The default NUM is 5.

       -mbranches-within-32B-boundaries
           This  option  aligns conditional jumps, fused conditional jumps and unconditional jumps within 32 byte boundary
           with  up  to  5  segment  prefixes  on  an  instruction.   It  is  equivalent   to   -malign-branch-boundary=32
           -malign-branch=jcc+fused+jmp -malign-branch-prefix-size=5.  The default doesn't align branches.

       -mlfence-after-load=no
       -mlfence-after-load=yes
           These   options   control   whether   the   assembler   should   generate   lfence   after  load  instructions.
           -mlfence-after-load=yes will generate lfence.  -mlfence-after-load=no will not generate lfence,  which  is  the
           default.

       -mlfence-before-indirect-branch=none
       -mlfence-before-indirect-branch=all
       -mlfence-before-indirect-branch=register
       -mlfence-before-indirect-branch=memory
           These  options  control  whether the assembler should generate lfence before indirect near branch instructions.
           -mlfence-before-indirect-branch=all will generate lfence before indirect near branch via register and  issue  a
           warning  before  indirect near branch via memory.  It also implicitly sets -mlfence-before-ret=shl when there's
           no  explicit  -mlfence-before-ret=.   -mlfence-before-indirect-branch=register  will  generate  lfence   before
           indirect near branch via register.  -mlfence-before-indirect-branch=memory will issue a warning before indirect
           near branch via memory.  -mlfence-before-indirect-branch=none will not generate lfence nor issue warning, which
           is  the  default.   Note  that  lfence  won't  be  generated  before  indirect  near  branch  via register with
           -mlfence-after-load=yes since lfence will be generated after loading branch target register.

       -mlfence-before-ret=none
       -mlfence-before-ret=shl
       -mlfence-before-ret=or
       -mlfence-before-ret=yes
       -mlfence-before-ret=not
           These options control whether the assembler should generate lfence  before  ret.   -mlfence-before-ret=or  will
           generate  generate  or instruction with lfence.  -mlfence-before-ret=shl/yes will generate shl instruction with
           lfence. -mlfence-before-ret=not will generate not instruction with lfence.  -mlfence-before-ret=none  will  not
           generate lfence, which is the default.

       -mx86-used-note=no
       -mx86-used-note=yes
           These    options    control   whether   the   assembler   should   generate   GNU_PROPERTY_X86_ISA_1_USED   and
           GNU_PROPERTY_X86_FEATURE_2_USED   GNU   property   notes.    The   default   can   be   controlled    by    the
           --enable-x86-used-note configure option.

       -mevexrcig=rne
       -mevexrcig=rd
       -mevexrcig=ru
       -mevexrcig=rz
           These  options  control how the assembler should encode SAE-only EVEX instructions.  -mevexrcig=rne will encode
           RC bits of EVEX instruction with 00, which is the default.  -mevexrcig=rd, -mevexrcig=ru and -mevexrcig=rz will
           encode SAE-only EVEX instructions with 01, 10 and 11 RC bits, respectively.

       -mamd64
       -mintel64
           This option specifies that the assembler should accept only AMD64 or Intel64 ISA in 64-bit mode.   The  default
           is to accept common, Intel64 only and AMD64 ISAs.

       -O0 | -O | -O1 | -O2 | -Os
           Optimize  instruction  encoding  with  smaller  instruction  size.   -O  and  -O1  encode  64-bit register load
           instructions with 64-bit immediate as 32-bit register load instructions  with  31-bit  or  32-bits  immediates,
           encode 64-bit register clearing instructions with 32-bit register clearing instructions, encode 256-bit/512-bit
           VEX/EVEX  vector  register clearing instructions with 128-bit VEX vector register clearing instructions, encode
           128-bit/256-bit EVEX vector register load/store instructions with VEX vector register load/store  instructions,
           and  encode  128-bit/256-bit  EVEX  packed integer logical instructions with 128-bit/256-bit VEX packed integer
           logical.

           -O2 includes -O1 optimization plus encodes 256-bit/512-bit EVEX  vector  register  clearing  instructions  with
           128-bit  EVEX  vector register clearing instructions.  In 64-bit mode VEX encoded instructions with commutative
           source operands will also have their source operands swapped if this allows using the 2-byte  VEX  prefix  form
           instead of the 3-byte one.  Certain forms of AND as well as OR with the same (register) operand specified twice
           will also be changed to TEST.

           -Os  includes  -O2  optimization  plus encodes 16-bit, 32-bit and 64-bit register tests with immediate as 8-bit
           register test with immediate.  -O0 turns off this optimization.

       The following options are available when as is configured for the Ubicom IP2K series.

       -mip2022ext
           Specifies that the extended IP2022 instructions are allowed.

       -mip2022
           Restores the default behaviour, which restricts the permitted instructions to just the basic IP2022 ones.

       The following options are available when as is configured for the Renesas M32C and M16C processors.

       -m32c
           Assemble M32C instructions.

       -m16c
           Assemble M16C instructions (the default).

       -relax
           Enable support for link-time relaxations.

       -h-tick-hex
           Support H'00 style hex constants in addition to 0x00 style.

       The following options are available when as is configured for the Renesas M32R (formerly Mitsubishi M32R) series.

       --m32rx
           Specify which processor in the M32R family is the target.  The default is normally the M32R,  but  this  option
           changes it to the M32RX.

       --warn-explicit-parallel-conflicts or --Wp
           Produce warning messages when questionable parallel constructs are encountered.

       --no-warn-explicit-parallel-conflicts or --Wnp
           Do not produce warning messages when questionable parallel constructs are encountered.

       The following options are available when as is configured for the Motorola 68000 series.

       -l  Shorten references to undefined symbols, to one word instead of two.

       -m68000 | -m68008 | -m68010 | -m68020 | -m68030
       | -m68040 | -m68060 | -m68302 | -m68331 | -m68332
       | -m68333 | -m68340 | -mcpu32 | -m5200
           Specify  what  processor in the 68000 family is the target.  The default is normally the 68020, but this can be
           changed at configuration time.

       -m68881 | -m68882 | -mno-68881 | -mno-68882
           The target machine does (or does  not)  have  a  floating-point  coprocessor.   The  default  is  to  assume  a
           coprocessor  for  68020,  68030,  and  cpu32.   Although  the  basic  68000 is not compatible with the 68881, a
           combination of the two can be specified, since it's possible to do emulation of  the  coprocessor  instructions
           with the main processor.

       -m68851 | -mno-68851
           The  target  machine does (or does not) have a memory-management unit coprocessor.  The default is to assume an
           MMU for 68020 and up.

       The following options are available when as is configured for an Altera Nios II processor.

       -relax-section
           Replace identified out-of-range branches with PC-relative "jmp" sequences when possible.   The  generated  code
           sequences  are  suitable  for  use in position-independent code, but there is a practical limit on the extended
           branch range because of the length of the sequences.  This option is the default.

       -relax-all
           Replace branch instructions not determinable to be in range and all call instructions with  "jmp"  and  "callr"
           sequences  (respectively).   This  option  generates absolute relocations against the target symbols and is not
           appropriate for position-independent code.

       -no-relax
           Do not replace any branches or calls.

       -EB Generate big-endian output.

       -EL Generate little-endian output.  This is the default.

       -march=architecture
           This option specifies the target architecture.  The assembler issues an error message if an attempt is made  to
           assemble  an  instruction  which will not execute on the target architecture.  The following architecture names
           are recognized: "r1", "r2".  The default is "r1".

       The following options are available when as is configured for a PRU processor.

       -mlink-relax
           Assume that LD would optimize LDI32 instructions by checking the upper 16 bits of the expression. If  they  are
           all  zeros,  then  LD  would  shorten the LDI32 instruction to a single LDI. In such case "as" will output DIFF
           relocations for diff expressions.

       -mno-link-relax
           Assume that LD would not optimize LDI32 instructions. As a consequence, DIFF relocations will not be emitted.

       -mno-warn-regname-label
           Do not warn if a label name matches a register name. Usually assembler programmers will want this warning to be
           emitted. C compilers may want to turn this off.

       The following options are available when as is configured for a MIPS processor.

       -G num
           This option sets the largest size of an object that can be referenced implicitly with the "gp" register.  It is
           only accepted for targets that use ECOFF format, such as a DECstation running Ultrix.  The default value is 8.

       -EB Generate "big endian" format output.

       -EL Generate "little endian" format output.

           Do  not attempt to schedule the preceding instruction into the delay slot of a branch instruction placed at the
           end of a short loop of six instructions or fewer and always schedule a "nop" instruction  there  instead.   The
           short  loop  bug  under certain conditions causes loops to execute only once or twice, due to a hardware bug in
           the R5900 chip.

       -mdebug
       -no-mdebug

           registers  to  be  treated as 32 bits wide at all times.  -mgp32 controls the size of general-purpose registers
           and -mfp32 controls the size of floating-point registers.

       -mgp64
       -mfp64

           registers  to  be  treated as 64 bits wide at all times.  -mgp64 controls the size of general-purpose registers
           and -mfp64 controls the size of floating-point registers.

       -mfpxx
           The register sizes are normally inferred from the ISA and ABI, but using this flag in combination with -mabi=32
           enables an ABI variant which will operate correctly with floating-point registers which are 32 or 64 bits wide.

       -modd-spreg
       -mno-odd-spreg
           Enable use of floating-point operations on odd-numbered single-precision registers when supported by  the  ISA.

       -mmicromips
       -mno-micromips
           Generate  code  for the microMIPS processor.  This is equivalent to putting ".module micromips" at the start of
           the assembly file.  -mno-micromips turns off this option.  This is equivalent to putting ".module  nomicromips"
           at the start of the assembly file.

           assembler to accept CRC instructions.  -mno-crc turns off this option.

       -mginv
       -mno-ginv
           Generate code for the Global INValidate (GINV) Application Specific Extension.  This  tells  the  assembler  to
           accept GINV instructions.  -mno-ginv turns off this option.

           tells the assembler to accept Loongson EXT2 instructions.  -mno-loongson-ext2 turns off this option.

       -minsn32
       -mno-insn32
           Only  use  32-bit instruction encodings when generating code for the microMIPS processor.  This option inhibits
           the use of any 16-bit instructions.  This is equivalent to putting ".set insn32" at the start of  the  assembly
           file.   -mno-insn32  turns  off this option.  This is equivalent to putting ".set noinsn32" at the start of the
           assembly file.  By default -mno-insn32 is selected, allowing all instructions to be used.

       --construct-floats
       --no-construct-floats
           The --no-construct-floats option disables the construction of double width floating point constants by  loading
           the  two  halves  of the value into the two single width floating point registers that make up the double width
           register.  By default --construct-floats is selected, allowing construction of these floating point constants.

       --relax-branch
       --no-relax-branch
           The --relax-branch option enables the relaxation of out-of-range branches.   By  default  --no-relax-branch  is
           selected, causing any out-of-range branches to produce an error.

       -mignore-branch-isa
       -mno-ignore-branch-isa
           Ignore branch checks for invalid transitions between ISA modes.  The semantics of branches does not provide for
           an  ISA  mode switch, so in most cases the ISA mode a branch has been encoded for has to be the same as the ISA
           mode of the branch's target label.  Therefore GAS has checks implemented that verify in  branch  assembly  that
           the  two  ISA  modes  match.   -mignore-branch-isa disables these checks.  By default -mno-ignore-branch-isa is
           selected, causing any invalid branch requiring a transition between ISA modes to produce an error.

       -mnan=encoding
           Select between the IEEE 754-2008 (-mnan=2008) or the legacy (-mnan=legacy) NaN encoding format.  The latter  is
           the default.

       --emulation=name
           This  option  was  formerly  used  to switch between ELF and ECOFF output on targets like IRIX 5 that supported
           both.  MIPS ECOFF support was removed in GAS 2.24, so the option now serves little purpose.  It is retained for
           backwards compatibility.

           The available configuration names are: mipself, mipslelf and mipsbelf.  Choosing mipself  now  has  no  effect,
           since  the  output is always ELF.  mipslelf and mipsbelf select little- and big-endian output respectively, but
           -EL and -EB are now the preferred options instead.

       -nocpp
           as ignores this option.  It is accepted for compatibility with the native tools.

       --trap
       --no-trap
       --break
       --no-break
           Control how to deal with multiplication overflow and  division  by  zero.   --trap  or  --no-break  (which  are
           synonyms) take a trap exception (and only work for Instruction Set Architecture level 2 and higher); --break or
           --no-trap (also synonyms, and the default) take a break exception.

       -n  When this option is used, as will issue a warning every time it generates a nop instruction from a macro.

       The following options are available when as is configured for a LoongArch processor.

       -fpic

       -march=ISA
           Select the base isa, as specified by ISA.  For example -march=rv32ima.  If this  option  and  the  architecture
           attributes aren't set, then assembler will check the default configure setting --with-arch=ISA.

       -misa-spec=ISAspec
           Select  the  default  isa spec version.  If the version of ISA isn't set by -march, then assembler helps to set
           the version according to the default chosen spec.  If this option isn't set,  then  assembler  will  check  the
           default configure setting --with-isa-spec=ISAspec.

       -mpriv-spec=PRIVspec
           Select  the  privileged  spec  version.   We can decide whether the CSR is valid or not according to the chosen
           spec.  If this option and the privilege attributes aren't set, then assembler will check the default  configure
           setting --with-priv-spec=PRIVspec.

       -mabi=ABI
           Selects the ABI, which is either "ilp32" or "lp64", optionally followed by "f", "d", or "q" to indicate single-
           precision,  double-precision,  or  quad-precision floating-point calling convention, or none or "e" to indicate
           the soft-float calling convention ("e" indicates a soft-float RVE ABI).

       -mrelax
           Take advantage of linker relaxations to reduce the  number  of  instructions  required  to  materialize  symbol
           addresses. (default)

       -mno-relax
           Don't do linker relaxations.

       -march-attr
           Generate  the  default  contents  for the riscv elf attribute section if the .attribute directives are not set.
           This section is used to record the information that a linker or runtime loader needs  to  check  compatibility.
           This  information  includes  ISA string, stack alignment requirement, unaligned memory accesses, and the major,
           minor and revision version of privileged specification.

       -mno-arch-attr
           Don't generate the default riscv elf attribute section if the .attribute directives are not set.

       -mcsr-check
           Enable the CSR checking for the ISA-dependent CRS and the read-only CSR.  The ISA-dependent CSR are only  valid
           when the specific ISA is set.  The read-only CSR can not be written by the CSR instructions.

       -mno-csr-check
           Don't do CSR checking.

       -mlittle-endian
           Generate code for a little endian machine.

       -mbig-endian
           Generate code for a big endian machine.

       See the info pages for documentation of the RX-specific options.

       The following options are available when as is configured for the s390 processor family.

       -m31
       -m64
           Select the word size, either 31/32 bits or 64 bits.

       -mesa
       -mzarch
           Select  the  architecture  mode,  either  the  Enterprise  System Architecture (esa) or the z/Architecture mode
           (zarch).

       -march=processor
           Specify which s390 processor variant is the target, g5 (or arch3),  g6,  z900  (or  arch5),  z990  (or  arch6),
           z9-109, z9-ec (or arch7), z10 (or arch8), z196 (or arch9), zEC12 (or arch10), z13 (or arch11), z14 (or arch12),
           z15 (or arch13), or z16 (or arch14).

       -mregnames
       -mno-regnames
           Allow or disallow symbolic names for registers.

       -mwarn-areg-zero
           Warn whenever the operand for a base or index register has been specified but evaluates to zero.

       The following options are available when as is configured for a TMS320C6000 processor.

       -march=arch
           Enable (only) instructions from architecture arch.  By default, all instructions are permitted.

           The following values of arch are accepted: "c62x", "c64x", "c64x+", "c67x", "c67x+", "c674x".

       -mdsbt
       -mno-dsbt
           The  -mdsbt  option causes the assembler to generate the "Tag_ABI_DSBT" attribute with a value of 1, indicating
           that the code is using DSBT addressing.  The -mno-dsbt option, the default, causes the tag to have a  value  of
           0,  indicating  that  the  code  does  not  use  DSBT addressing.  The linker will emit a warning if objects of
           different type (DSBT and non-DSBT) are linked together.

       -mpid=no
       -mpid=near
       -mpid=far
           The -mpid= option causes the assembler to generate the "Tag_ABI_PID" attribute with a value indicating the form
           of data addressing used by the code.  -mpid=no, the  default,  indicates  position-dependent  data  addressing,
           -mpid=near  indicates position-independent addressing with GOT accesses using near DP addressing, and -mpid=far
           indicates position-independent addressing with GOT accesses using far DP addressing.  The linker  will  emit  a
           warning if objects built with different settings of this option are linked together.

       -mpic
       -mno-pic
           The  -mpic  option  causes  the assembler to generate the "Tag_ABI_PIC" attribute with a value of 1, indicating
           that the code is using position-independent code addressing,  The "-mno-pic" option, the  default,  causes  the
           tag  to  have  a  value of 0, indicating position-dependent code addressing.  The linker will emit a warning if
           objects of different type (position-dependent and position-independent) are linked together.

       -mbig-endian
       -mlittle-endian
           Generate code for the specified endianness.  The default is little-endian.

       The following options are available when as is configured for a TILE-Gx processor.

       -m32 | -m64
           Select the word size, either 32 bits or 64 bits.

       -EB | -EL
           Select the endianness, either big-endian (-EB) or little-endian (-EL).

       The following option is available when as is configured for a Visium processor.

       -mtune=arch
           This option specifies the target architecture.  If an attempt is made to assemble an instruction that will  not
           execute on the target architecture, the assembler will issue an error message.

           The following names are recognized: "mcm24" "mcm" "gr5" "gr6"

       The following options are available when as is configured for an Xtensa processor.

       --text-section-literals | --no-text-section-literals
           Control  the  treatment  of literal pools.  The default is --no-text-section-literals, which places literals in
           separate sections in the output file.  This allows the literal pool to be  placed  in  a  data  RAM/ROM.   With
           --text-section-literals,  the  literals  are interspersed in the text section in order to keep them as close as
           possible to their references.  This may be necessary  for  large  assembly  files,  where  the  literals  would
           otherwise  be  out  of  range  of the "L32R" instructions in the text section.  Literals are grouped into pools
           following ".literal_position" directives or preceding "ENTRY" instructions.  These options only affect literals
           referenced via PC-relative "L32R" instructions; literals for absolute  mode  "L32R"  instructions  are  handled
           separately.

       --auto-litpools | --no-auto-litpools
           Control  the  treatment  of  literal  pools.   The  default  is  --no-auto-litpools,  which  in  the absence of
           --text-section-literals places literals in separate sections in the output file.  This allows the literal  pool
           to  be  placed  in  a data RAM/ROM.  With --auto-litpools, the literals are interspersed in the text section in
           order to keep them as close as possible to their references, explicit ".literal_position"  directives  are  not
           required.   This  may  be necessary for very large functions, where single literal pool at the beginning of the
           function may not be reachable by "L32R" instructions at the end.  These options only affect literals referenced
           via PC-relative "L32R" instructions; literals for absolute mode "L32R"  instructions  are  handled  separately.
           When used together with --text-section-literals, --auto-litpools takes precedence.

       --absolute-literals | --no-absolute-literals
           Indicate to the assembler whether "L32R" instructions use absolute or PC-relative addressing.  If the processor
           includes  the  absolute  addressing option, the default is to use absolute "L32R" relocations.  Otherwise, only
           the PC-relative "L32R" relocations can be used.

       --target-align | --no-target-align
           Enable or disable automatic alignment to reduce  branch  penalties  at  some  expense  in  code  size.     This
           optimization  is  enabled  by default.  Note that the assembler will always align instructions like "LOOP" that
           have fixed alignment requirements.

       --longcalls | --no-longcalls
           Enable or disable transformation of call instructions to allow calls  across  a  greater  range  of  addresses.
           This  option  should  be used when call targets can potentially be out of range.  It may degrade both code size
           and performance, but the linker can generally optimize away the unnecessary overhead when a call ends up within
           range.  The default is --no-longcalls.

       --transform | --no-transform
           Enable or disable  all  assembler  transformations  of  Xtensa  instructions,  including  both  relaxation  and
           optimization.   The  default  is  --transform;  --no-transform  should  only be used in the rare cases when the
           instructions must be exactly as specified in the assembly source.  Using --no-transform  causes  out  of  range
           instruction operands to be errors.

       --rename-section oldname=newname
           Rename the oldname section to newname.  This option can be used multiple times to rename multiple sections.

       --trampolines | --no-trampolines
           Enable  or  disable  transformation  of  jump  instructions to allow jumps across a greater range of addresses.
           This option should be used when jump targets can potentially be out of range.  In the  absence  of  such  jumps
           this option does not affect code size or performance.  The default is --trampolines.

       --abi-windowed | --abi-call0
           Choose  ABI  tag written to the ".xtensa.info" section.  ABI tag indicates ABI of the assembly code.  A warning
           is issued by the linker on an attempt to link object files with inconsistent ABI tags.  Default ABI  is  chosen
           by the Xtensa core configuration.

       The following options are available when as is configured for an Z80 processor.

       @chapter Z80 Dependent Features

   Command-line Options
       -march=CPU[-EXT...][+EXT...]
           This  option specifies the target processor. The assembler will issue an error message if an attempt is made to
           assemble an instruction which will not execute on the target  processor.  The  following  processor  names  are
           recognized:  "z80",  "z180",  "ez80",  "gbz80",  "z80n", "r800".  In addition to the basic instruction set, the
           assembler can be told to accept some extension mnemonics. For example, "-march=z180+sli+infc" extends z180 with
           SLI  instructions  and  IN  F,(C).  The  following  extensions  are  currently  supported:  "full"  (all  known
           instructions), "adl" (ADL CPU mode by default, eZ80 only), "sli" (instruction known as SLI, SLL or SL1), "xyhl"
           (instructions with halves of index registers: IXL, IXH, IYL, IYH), "xdcb" (instructions like RotOp (II+d),R and
           BitOp  n,(II+d),R), "infc" (instruction IN F,(C) or IN (C)), "outc0" (instruction OUT (C),0).  Note that rather
           than extending a basic instruction set, the  extension  mnemonics  starting  with  "-"  revoke  the  respective
           functionality: "-march=z80-full+xyhl" first removes all default extensions and adds support for index registers
           halves only.

           If this option is not specified then "-march=z80+xyhl+infc" is assumed.

       -local-prefix=prefix
           Mark  all  labels  with  specified prefix as local. But such label can be marked global explicitly in the code.
           This option do not change default local label prefix ".L", it is just adds new one.

       -colonless
           Accept colonless labels. All symbols at line begin are treated as labels.

       -sdcc
           Accept assembler code produced by SDCC.

       -fp-s=FORMAT
           Single precision floating point numbers format. Default: ieee754 (32 bit).

       -fp-d=FORMAT
           Double precision floating point numbers format. Default: ieee754 (64 bit).

AA-STATUS(8)                                             AppArmor                                             AA-STATUS(8)

NAME
       aa-status - display various information about the current AppArmor policy.

SYNOPSIS
       aa-status [option]

DESCRIPTION
       aa-status will report various aspects of the current state of AppArmor confinement. By default, it displays the
       same information as if the --verbose argument were given. A sample of what this looks like is:

         apparmor module is loaded.
         110 profiles are loaded.
         102 profiles are in enforce mode.
         8 profiles are in complain mode.
         Out of 129 processes running:
         13 processes have profiles defined.
         8 processes have profiles in enforce mode.
         5 processes have profiles in complain mode.

       Other argument options are provided to report individual aspects, to support being used in scripts.

OPTIONS
       aa-status accepts only one argument at a time out of:

       --enabled
           returns error code if AppArmor is not enabled.

       --profiled
           displays the number of loaded AppArmor policies.

       --enforced
           displays the number of loaded enforcing AppArmor policies.

       --complaining
           displays the number of loaded non-enforcing AppArmor policies.

       --kill
           displays the number of loaded enforcing AppArmor policies that will kill tasks on policy violations.

       --prompt
           displays the number of loaded enforcing AppArmor policies, with fallback to userspace mediation.

       --special-unconfined
           displays the number of loaded non-enforcing AppArmor policies that are in the special unconfined mode.

       --process-mixed displays the number of processes confined by profile stacks with profiles in different modes.
       --verbose
           displays multiple data points about loaded AppArmor policy set (the default action if no arguments are given).

       --json
           displays multiple data points about loaded AppArmor policy set in a JSON format, fit for machine consumption.

       --pretty-json
           same as --json, formatted to be readable by humans as well as by machines.

       --show
           what  data  sets to show information about. Currently processes, profiles, all for both processes and profiles.
           The default is all.

       --count
           display only counts for selected information.

       --filter.mode=filter
           Allows specifying a posix regular expression filter that will be applied against the displayed  processess  and
           profiles apparmor profile mode, reducing the output.

       --filter.profiles=filter
           Allows  specifying  a posix regular expression filter that will be applied against the displayed processess and
           profiles confining profile, reducing the output.

       --filter.pid=filter
           Allows specifying a posix regular expression filter that will be applied against the  displayed  processes,  so
           that only processes pids matching the expression will be displayed.

       --filter.exe=filter
           Allows  specifying  a  posix regular expression filter that will be applied against the displayed processes, so
           that only processes executable name matching the expression will be displayed.

       --help
           displays a short usage statement.

EXIT STATUS
       Upon exiting, aa-status will set its exit status to the following values:

       0   if apparmor is enabled and policy is loaded.

       1   if apparmor is not enabled/loaded.

       2   if apparmor is enabled but no policy is loaded.

       3   if the apparmor control files aren't available under /sys/kernel/security/.

       4   if the user running the script doesn't have enough privileges to read the apparmor control files.

       42  if an internal error occurred.

BUGS
       aa-status must be run as root to read the state of the loaded policy from the apparmor module. It  uses  the  /proc
       filesystem to determine which processes are confined and so is susceptible to race conditions.

       If you find any additional bugs, please report them at <https://gitlab.com/apparmor/apparmor/-/issues>.

ALSABAT(1)                                        General Commands Manual                                       ALSABAT(1)

NAME
       alsabat - command-line sound tester for ALSA sound card driver

SYNOPSIS
       alsabat [flags]

DESCRIPTION
       ALSABAT(ALSA  Basic Audio Tester) is a simple command-line utility intended to help automate audio driver and sound
       server testing with little human interaction. ALSABAT can be used to test audio quality, stress test  features  and
       test audio before and after PM state changes.

       ALSABAT's design is relatively simple. ALSABAT plays an audio stream and captures the same stream in either a digi‐
       tal  or analog loop back. It then compares the captured stream using a FFT to the original to determine if the test
       case passes or fails.

       ALSABAT can either run wholly on the target machine being tested (standalone mode) or can run  as  a  client/server
       mode  where  by  alsabat  client  runs  on  the  target  and  runs  as  a  server on a separate tester machine. The
       client/server mode still requires some manual interaction for synchronization, but this is actively being developed
       for future releases.

       The hardware testing configuration may require the use of an analog cable connecting target to tester machines or a
       cable to create an analog loopback if no loopback mode is available on the sound hardware that is being tested.  An
       analog loopback cable can be used to connect the "line in" to "line out" jacks to create a loopback. If only  head‐
       phone and mic jacks (or combo jack) are available then the following simple circuit can be used to create an analog
       loopback :-

       https://source.android.com/devices/audio/loopback.html

       If  tinyalsa  is  installed  in  system,  user can choose tinyalsa as backend lib of alsabat, with configure option
       "--enable-alsabat-backend-tiny".

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Help: show syntax.

       -D     Select sound card to be tested by name.

       -P     Select the playback PCM device.

       -C     Select the capture PCM device.

       -f     Sample format
              Recognized sample formats are: U8 S16_LE S24_3LE S32_LE
              Some of these may not be available on selected hardware
              The available format shortcuts are:
              -f cd (16 bit little endian, 44100, stereo) [-f S16_LE -c2 -r44100]
              -f dat (16 bit little endian, 48000, stereo) [-f S16_LE -c2 -r48000]
              If no format is given S16_LE is used.

       -c     The number of channels. The default is one channel.  Valid values at the moment are 1 or 2.

       -r     Sampling rate in Hertz. The default rate is 44100 Hertz.  Valid values depends on hardware support.

       -n     Duration of generated signal.  The value could be either of the two forms:
              1. Decimal integer, means number of frames;
              2. Floating point with suffix 's', means number of seconds.
              The default is 2 seconds.

       -k     Sigma k value for analysis.
              The analysis function reads data from WAV file, run FFT against the data to get magnitude of frequency  vec‐
              tors,  and then calculates the average value and standard deviation of frequency vectors. After that, we de‐
              fine a threshold:
              threshold = k * standard_deviation + mean_value
              Frequencies with amplitude larger than threshold will be recognized  as  a  peak,  and  the  frequency  with
              largest peak value will be recognized as a detected frequency.
              ALSABAT  then  compares  the  detected  frequency  to target frequency, to decide if the detecting passes or
              fails.
              The default value is 3.0.

       -F     Target frequency for signal generation and analysis, in Hertz.  The default is 997.0 Hertz.  Valid range  is
              (DC_THRESHOLD, 40% * Sampling rate).

       -p     Total number of periods to play or capture.

       --log=#
              Write stderr and stdout output to this log file.

       --file=#
              Input WAV file for playback.

       --saveplay=#
              Target WAV file to save capture test content.

       --local
              Internal  loopback  mode.  Playback, capture and analysis internal to ALSABAT only. This is intended for de‐
              velopers to test new ALSABAT features as no audio is routed outside of ALSABAT.

       --standalone
              Add support for standalone mode where ALSABAT will run on a different machine to the one being  tested.   In
              standalone  mode,  the sound data can be generated, playback and captured just like in normal mode, but will
              not be analyzed.  The ALSABAT being built without libfftw3  support  is  always  in  standalone  mode.   The
              ALSABAT in normal mode can also bypass data analysis using option "--standalone".

       --roundtriplatency
              Round trip latency test.  Audio latency is the time delay as an audio signal passes through a system.  There
              are  many  kinds  of audio latency metrics. One useful metric is the round trip latency, which is the sum of
              output latency and input latency.

       --snr-db=#
              Noise detection threshold in SNR (dB). 26dB indicates 5% noise in amplitude.  ALSABAT will return  error  if
              signal SNR is smaller than the threshold.

       --snr-pc=#
              Noise  detection threshold in percentage of noise amplitude (%).  ALSABAT will return error if the noise am‐
              plitude is larger than the threshold.

EXAMPLES
       alsabat -P plughw:0,0 -C plughw:0,0 -c 2 -f S32_LE -F 250
              Generate and play a sine wave of 250 Hertz with 2 channel and S32_LE format, and then capture and analyze.

       alsabat -P plughw:0,0 -C plughw:0,0 --file 500Hz.wav
              Play the RIFF WAV file "500Hz.wav" which contains 500 Hertz waveform LPCM data, and then  capture  and  ana‐
              lyze.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, returns 0.
       If no peak be detected, returns -1001;
       If only DC be detected, returns -1002;
       If peak frequency does not match with the target frequency, returns -1003.

BUGS
       Currently only support RIFF WAV format with PCM data. Please report any bugs to the alsa-devel mailing list.

NAME
       applygnupgdefaults - Run gpgconf --apply-defaults for all users.

SYNOPSIS
       applygnupgdefaults

DESCRIPTION
       This  is  a  legacy  script.   Modern  application  should  use  the per component global configuration files under
       ‘/etc/gnupg/’.

       This script is a wrapper around gpgconf to run it with the command --apply-defaults for all real users with an  ex‐
       isting  GnuPG  home directory.  Admins might want to use this script to update he GnuPG configuration files for all
       users after ‘/etc/gnupg/gpgconf.conf’ has been changed.  This allows enforcing  certain  policies  for  all  users.
       Note,  that  this is not a bulletproof way to force a user to use certain options.  A user may always directly edit
       the configuration files and bypass gpgconf.

       applygnupgdefaults is invoked by root as:

         applygnupgdefaults

NAME
       apt-get - APT package handling utility -- command-line interface

SYNOPSIS

       apt-get [-sqdyfmubV] [-o=config_string] [-c=config_file] [-t=target_release] [-a=architecture] {update | upgrade |
               dselect-upgrade | dist-upgrade | install pkg [{=pkg_version_number | /target_release}]...  | remove pkg...
               | purge pkg...  | source pkg [{=pkg_version_number | /target_release}]...  |
               build-dep pkg [{=pkg_version_number | /target_release}]...  |
               download pkg [{=pkg_version_number | /target_release}]...  | check | clean | autoclean | autoremove |
               {-v | --version} | {-h | --help}}

DESCRIPTION
       apt-get is the command-line tool for handling packages, and may be considered the user's "back-end" to other tools
       using the APT library. Several "front-end" interfaces exist, such as aptitude(8), synaptic(8) and wajig(1).

       Unless the -h, or --help option is given, one of the commands below must be present.

       update
           update is used to resynchronize the package index files from their sources. The indexes of available packages
           are fetched from the location(s) specified in /etc/apt/sources.list. For example, when using a Debian archive,
           this command retrieves and scans the Packages.gz files, so that information about new and updated packages is
           available. An update should always be performed before an upgrade or dist-upgrade. Please be aware that the
           overall progress meter will be incorrect as the size of the package files cannot be known in advance.

       upgrade
           upgrade is used to install the newest versions of all packages currently installed on the system from the
           sources enumerated in /etc/apt/sources.list. Packages currently installed with new versions available are
           retrieved and upgraded; under no circumstances are currently installed packages removed, or packages not
           already installed retrieved and installed. New versions of currently installed packages that cannot be upgraded
           without changing the install status of another package will be left at their current version. An update must be
           performed first so that apt-get knows that new versions of packages are available.

           When a package is supplied as an argument, the package will be installed prior to the upgrade action.

       dist-upgrade
           dist-upgrade in addition to performing the function of upgrade, also intelligently handles changing
           dependencies with new versions of packages; apt-get has a "smart" conflict resolution system, and it will
           attempt to upgrade the most important packages at the expense of less important ones if necessary. The
           dist-upgrade command may therefore remove some packages. The /etc/apt/sources.list file contains a list of
           locations from which to retrieve desired package files. See also apt_preferences(5) for a mechanism for
           overriding the general settings for individual packages.

           When a package is supplied as an argument, the package will be installed prior to the upgrade action.

       dselect-upgrade
           dselect-upgrade is used in conjunction with the traditional Debian packaging front-end, dselect(1).
           dselect-upgrade follows the changes made by dselect(1) to the Status field of available packages, and performs
           the actions necessary to realize that state (for instance, the removal of old and the installation of new
           packages).

       install
           install is followed by one or more packages desired for installation or upgrading. Each package is a package
           name, not a fully qualified filename (for instance, in a Debian system, apt-utils would be the argument
           provided, not apt-utils_2.7.14_amd64.deb). All packages required by the package(s) specified for installation
           will also be retrieved and installed. The /etc/apt/sources.list file is used to locate the desired packages. If
           a hyphen is appended to the package name (with no intervening space), the identified package will be removed if
           it is installed. Similarly a plus sign can be used to designate a package to install. These latter features may
           be used to override decisions made by apt-get's conflict resolution system.

           A specific version of a package can be selected for installation by following the package name with an equals
           and the version of the package to select. This will cause that version to be located and selected for install.
           Alternatively a specific distribution can be selected by following the package name with a slash and the
           version of the distribution or the Archive name (stable, testing, unstable).

           Both of the version selection mechanisms can downgrade packages and must be used with care.

           This is also the target to use if you want to upgrade one or more already-installed packages without upgrading
           every package you have on your system. Unlike the "upgrade" target, which installs the newest version of all
           currently installed packages, "install" will install the newest version of only the package(s) specified.
           Simply provide the name of the package(s) you wish to upgrade, and if a newer version is available, it (and its
           dependencies, as described above) will be downloaded and installed.

           Finally, the apt_preferences(5) mechanism allows you to create an alternative installation policy for
           individual packages.

           If no package matches the given expression and the expression contains one of '.', '?' or '*' then it is
           assumed to be a POSIX regular expression, and it is applied to all package names in the database. Any matches
           are then installed (or removed). Note that matching is done by substring so 'lo.*' matches 'how-lo' and
           'lowest'. If this is undesired, anchor the regular expression with a '^' or '$' character, or create a more
           specific regular expression.

           Fallback to regular expressions is deprecated in APT 2.0, has been removed in apt(8), except for anchored
           expressions, and will be removed from apt-get(8) in a future version. Use apt-patterns(7) instead.

       reinstall
           reinstall is an alias for install --reinstall.

       remove
           remove is identical to install except that packages are removed instead of installed. Note that removing a
           package leaves its configuration files on the system. If a plus sign is appended to the package name (with no
           intervening space), the identified package will be installed instead of removed.

       purge
           purge is identical to remove except that packages are removed and purged (any configuration files are deleted
           too).

       source
           source causes apt-get to fetch source packages. APT will examine the available packages to decide which source
           package to fetch. It will then find and download into the current directory the newest available version of
           that source package while respecting the default release, set with the option APT::Default-Release, the -t
           option or per package with the pkg/release syntax, if possible.

           The arguments are interpreted as binary and source package names. See the --only-source option if you want to
           change that.

           Source packages are tracked separately from binary packages via deb-src lines in the sources.list(5) file. This
           means that you will need to add such a line for each repository you want to get sources from; otherwise you
           will probably get either the wrong (too old/too new) source versions or none at all.

           If the --compile option is specified then the package will be compiled to a binary .deb using dpkg-buildpackage
           for the architecture as defined by the --host-architecture option. If --download-only is specified then the
           source package will not be unpacked.

           A specific source version can be retrieved by postfixing the source name with an equals and then the version to
           fetch, similar to the mechanism used for the package files. This enables exact matching of the source package
           name and version, implicitly enabling the APT::Get::Only-Source option.

           Note that source packages are not installed and tracked in the dpkg database like binary packages; they are
           simply downloaded to the current directory, like source tarballs.

       build-dep
           build-dep causes apt-get to install/remove packages in an attempt to satisfy the build dependencies for a
           source package. By default the dependencies are satisfied to build the package natively. If desired a
           host-architecture can be specified with the --host-architecture option instead.

           The arguments are interpreted as binary or source package names. See the --only-source option if you want to
           change that.

       satisfy
           satisfy causes apt-get to satisfy the given dependency strings. The dependency strings may have build profiles
           and architecture restriction list as in build dependencies. They may optionally be prefixed with "Conflicts: "
           to unsatisfy the dependency string. Multiple strings of the same type can be specified.

           Example: apt-get satisfy "foo" "Conflicts: bar" "baz (>> 1.0) | bar (= 2.0), moo"

           The legacy operator '</>' is not supported, use '<=/>=' instead.

       check
           check is a diagnostic tool; it updates the package cache and checks for broken dependencies.

       download
           download will download the given binary package into the current directory. The authenticity of the package
           data is ensured as usual.

       clean
           clean clears out the local repository of retrieved package files. It removes everything but the lock file from
           /var/cache/apt/archives/ and /var/cache/apt/archives/partial/.

       autoclean (and the auto-clean alias since 1.1)
           Like clean, autoclean clears out the local repository of retrieved package files. The difference is that it
           only removes package files that can no longer be downloaded, and are largely useless. This allows a cache to be
           maintained over a long period without it growing out of control. The configuration option APT::Clean-Installed
           will prevent installed packages from being erased if it is set to off.

       distclean (and the dist-clean alias)
           distclean removes all files under /var/lib/apt/lists except Release, Release.gpg, and InRelease. It can be used
           for example, when finalizing images distributed to users. The release files are kept for security reasons, to
           prevent various types of attacks.

       autoremove (and the auto-remove alias since 1.1)
           autoremove is used to remove packages that were automatically installed to satisfy dependencies for other
           packages and are now no longer needed.

       autopurge
           Like autoremove, but autopurge also removes configuration files. This is a shortcut for autoremove --purge.

       changelog
           changelog tries to download the changelog of a package and displays it through sensible-pager. By default it
           displays the changelog for the version that is installed. However, you can specify the same options as for the
           install command.

       indextargets
           Displays by default a deb822 formatted listing of information about all data files (aka index targets) apt-get
           update would download. Supports a --format option to modify the output format as well as accepts lines of the
           default output to filter the records by. The command is mainly used as an interface for external tools working
           with APT to get information as well as filenames for downloaded files so they can use them as well instead of
           downloading them again on their own. Detailed documentation is omitted here and can instead be found in the
           file /usr/share/doc/apt/acquire-additional-files.md.gz shipped by the apt-doc package.

OPTIONS
       All command line options may be set using the configuration file, the descriptions indicate the configuration
       option to set. For boolean options you can override the config file by using something like -f-,--no-f, -f=no or
       several other variations.

       --no-install-recommends
           Do not consider recommended packages as a dependency for installing. Configuration Item:
           APT::Install-Recommends.

       --install-suggests
           Consider suggested packages as a dependency for installing. Configuration Item: APT::Install-Suggests.

       -d, --download-only
           Download only; package files are only retrieved, not unpacked or installed. Configuration Item:
           APT::Get::Download-Only.

       -f, --fix-broken
           Fix; attempt to correct a system with broken dependencies in place. This option, when used with install/remove,
           can omit any packages to permit APT to deduce a likely solution. If packages are specified, these have to
           completely correct the problem. The option is sometimes necessary when running APT for the first time; APT
           itself does not allow broken package dependencies to exist on a system. It is possible that a system's
           dependency structure can be so corrupt as to require manual intervention (which usually means using dpkg
           --remove to eliminate some of the offending packages). Use of this option together with -m may produce an error
           in some situations. Configuration Item: APT::Get::Fix-Broken.

       -m, --ignore-missing, --fix-missing
           Ignore missing packages; if packages cannot be retrieved or fail the integrity check after retrieval (corrupted
           package files), hold back those packages and handle the result. Use of this option together with -f may produce
           an error in some situations. If a package is selected for installation (particularly if it is mentioned on the
           command line) and it could not be downloaded then it will be silently held back. Configuration Item:
           APT::Get::Fix-Missing.

       --no-download
           Disables downloading of packages. This is best used with --ignore-missing to force APT to use only the .debs it
           has already downloaded. Configuration Item: APT::Get::Download.

       -q, --quiet
           Quiet; produces output suitable for logging, omitting progress indicators. More q's will produce more quiet up
           to a maximum of 2. You can also use -q=# to set the quiet level, overriding the configuration file. Note that
           quiet level 2 implies -y; you should never use -qq without a no-action modifier such as -d, --print-uris or -s
           as APT may decide to do something you did not expect. Configuration Item: quiet.

       -s, --simulate, --just-print, --dry-run, --recon, --no-act
           No action; perform a simulation of events that would occur based on the current system state but do not
           actually change the system. Locking will be disabled (Debug::NoLocking) so the system state could change while
           apt-get is running. Simulations can also be executed by non-root users which might not have read access to all
           apt configuration distorting the simulation. A notice expressing this warning is also shown by default for
           non-root users (APT::Get::Show-User-Simulation-Note). Configuration Item: APT::Get::Simulate.

           Simulated runs print out a series of lines, each representing a dpkg operation: configure (Conf), remove (Remv)
           or unpack (Inst). Square brackets indicate broken packages, and empty square brackets indicate breaks that are
           of no consequence (rare).

       -y, --yes, --assume-yes
           Automatic yes to prompts; assume "yes" as answer to all prompts and run non-interactively. If an undesirable
           situation, such as changing a held package, trying to install an unauthenticated package or removing an
           essential package occurs then apt-get will abort. Configuration Item: APT::Get::Assume-Yes.

       --assume-no
           Automatic "no" to all prompts. Configuration Item: APT::Get::Assume-No.

       --no-show-upgraded
           Do not show a list of all packages that are to be upgraded. Configuration Item: APT::Get::Show-Upgraded.

       -V, --verbose-versions
           Show full versions for upgraded and installed packages. Configuration Item: APT::Get::Show-Versions.

       -a, --host-architecture
           This option controls the architecture packages are built for by apt-get source --compile and how
           cross-builddependencies are satisfied. By default is it not set which means that the host architecture is the
           same as the build architecture (which is defined by APT::Architecture). Configuration Item:
           APT::Get::Host-Architecture.

       -P, --build-profiles
           This option controls the activated build profiles for which a source package is built by apt-get source
           --compile and how build dependencies are satisfied. By default no build profile is active. More than one build
           profile can be activated at a time by concatenating them with a comma. Configuration Item: APT::Build-Profiles.

       -b, --compile, --build
           Compile source packages after downloading them. Configuration Item: APT::Get::Compile.

       --ignore-hold
           Ignore package holds; this causes apt-get to ignore a hold placed on a package. This may be useful in
           conjunction with dist-upgrade to override a large number of undesired holds. Configuration Item:
           APT::Ignore-Hold.

       --with-new-pkgs
           Allow installing new packages when used in conjunction with upgrade. This is useful if the update of an
           installed package requires new dependencies to be installed. Instead of holding the package back upgrade will
           upgrade the package and install the new dependencies. Note that upgrade with this option will never remove
           packages, only allow adding new ones. Configuration Item: APT::Get::Upgrade-Allow-New.

       --no-upgrade
           Do not upgrade packages; when used in conjunction with install, no-upgrade will prevent packages on the command
           line from being upgraded if they are already installed. Configuration Item: APT::Get::Upgrade.

       --only-upgrade
           Do not install new packages; when used in conjunction with install, only-upgrade will install upgrades for
           already installed packages only and ignore requests to install new packages. Configuration Item:
           APT::Get::Only-Upgrade.

       --allow-downgrades
           This is a dangerous option that will cause apt to continue without prompting if it is doing downgrades. It
           should not be used except in very special situations. Using it can potentially destroy your system!
           Configuration Item: APT::Get::allow-downgrades. Introduced in APT 1.1.

       --allow-remove-essential
           Force yes; this is a dangerous option that will cause apt to continue without prompting if it is removing
           essentials. It should not be used except in very special situations. Using it can potentially destroy your
           system! Configuration Item: APT::Get::allow-remove-essential. Introduced in APT 1.1.

       --allow-change-held-packages
           Force yes; this is a dangerous option that will cause apt to continue without prompting if it is changing held
           packages. It should not be used except in very special situations. Using it can potentially destroy your
           system! Configuration Item: APT::Get::allow-change-held-packages. Introduced in APT 1.1.

       --force-yes
           Force yes; this is a dangerous option that will cause apt to continue without prompting if it is doing
           something potentially harmful. It should not be used except in very special situations. Using force-yes can
           potentially destroy your system! Configuration Item: APT::Get::force-yes. This is deprecated and replaced by
           --allow-unauthenticated , --allow-downgrades , --allow-remove-essential , --allow-change-held-packages in 1.1.

       --print-uris
           Instead of fetching the files to install their URIs are printed. Each URI will have the path, the destination
           file name, the size and the expected MD5 hash. Note that the file name to write to will not always match the
           file name on the remote site! This also works with the source and update commands. When used with the update
           command the MD5 and size are not included, and it is up to the user to decompress any compressed files.
           Configuration Item: APT::Get::Print-URIs.

       --purge
           Use purge instead of remove for anything that would be removed. An asterisk ("*") will be displayed next to
           packages which are scheduled to be purged.  remove --purge is equivalent to the purge command. Configuration
           Item: APT::Get::Purge.

       --reinstall
           Re-install packages that are already installed and at the newest version. Configuration Item:
           APT::Get::ReInstall.

       --list-cleanup
           This option is on by default; use --no-list-cleanup to turn it off. When it is on, apt-get will automatically
           manage the contents of /var/lib/apt/lists to ensure that obsolete files are erased. The only reason to turn it
           off is if you frequently change your sources list. Configuration Item: APT::Get::List-Cleanup.

       -S, --snapshot
           This option controls the snapshot chosen for archives with Snapshot: enable in the source entry. For example,
           -S 20220102T030405Z selects a snapshot from January 2nd, 2022 at 03:04:05 UTC. Configuration Item:
           APT::Snapshot; see also the sources.list(5) manual page.

       -t, --target-release, --default-release
           This option controls the default input to the policy engine; it creates a default pin at priority 990 using the
           specified release string. This overrides the general settings in /etc/apt/preferences. Specifically pinned
           packages are not affected by the value of this option. In short, this option lets you have simple control over
           which distribution packages will be retrieved from. Some common examples might be -t '2.1*', -t unstable or -t
           sid. Configuration Item: APT::Default-Release; see also the apt_preferences(5) manual page.

       --trivial-only
           Only perform operations that are 'trivial'. Logically this can be considered related to --assume-yes; where
           --assume-yes will answer yes to any prompt, --trivial-only will answer no. Configuration Item:
           APT::Get::Trivial-Only.

       --mark-auto
           After successful installation, mark all freshly installed packages as automatically installed, which will cause
           each of the packages to be removed when no more manually installed packages depend on this package. This is
           equally to running apt-mark auto for all installed packages. Configuration Item: APT::Get::Mark-Auto.

       --no-remove
           If any packages are to be removed apt-get immediately aborts without prompting. Configuration Item:
           APT::Get::Remove.

       --auto-remove, --autoremove
           If the command is either install or remove, then this option acts like running the autoremove command, removing
           unused dependency packages. Configuration Item: APT::Get::AutomaticRemove.

       --only-source
           Only has meaning for the source and build-dep commands. Indicates that the given source names are not to be
           mapped through the binary table. This means that if this option is specified, these commands will only accept
           source package names as arguments, rather than accepting binary package names and looking up the corresponding
           source package. Configuration Item: APT::Get::Only-Source.

       --diff-only, --dsc-only, --tar-only
           Download only the diff, dsc, or tar file of a source archive. Configuration Item: APT::Get::Diff-Only,
           APT::Get::Dsc-Only, and APT::Get::Tar-Only.

       --arch-only
           Only process architecture-dependent build-dependencies. Configuration Item: APT::Get::Arch-Only.

       --indep-only
           Only process architecture-independent build-dependencies. Configuration Item: APT::Get::Indep-Only.

       --allow-unauthenticated
           Ignore if packages can't be authenticated and don't prompt about it. This can be useful while working with
           local repositories, but is a huge security risk if data authenticity isn't ensured in another way by the user
           itself. The usage of the Trusted option for sources.list(5) entries should usually be preferred over this
           global override. Configuration Item: APT::Get::AllowUnauthenticated.

       --allow-insecure-repositories
           Allow the update command to acquire unverifiable data from configured sources. APT will otherwise fail at the
           update command for repositories without valid cryptographically signatures. See also apt-secure(8) for details
           on the concept and the implications. Configuration Item: Acquire::AllowInsecureRepositories.

       --allow-releaseinfo-change
           Allow the update command to continue downloading data from a repository which changed its information of the
           release contained in the repository indicating e.g a new major release. APT will fail at the update command for
           such repositories until the change is confirmed to ensure the user is prepared for the change. See also apt-
           secure(8) for details on the concept and configuration.

           Specialist options (--allow-releaseinfo-change-field) exist to allow changes only for certain fields like
           origin, label, codename, suite, version and defaultpin. See also apt_preferences(5). Configuration Item:
           Acquire::AllowReleaseInfoChange.

       --show-progress
           Show user friendly progress information in the terminal window when packages are installed, upgraded or
           removed. For a machine parsable version of this data see README.progress-reporting in the apt doc directory.
           Configuration Items: Dpkg::Progress and Dpkg::Progress-Fancy.

       --with-source filename
           Adds the given file as a source for metadata. Can be repeated to add multiple files. See --with-source
           description in apt-cache(8) for further details.

       -eany, --error-on=any
           Fail the update command if any error occured, even a transient one.

       -U, --update
           Run the update command before the specified command. This is supported for commands installing, removing, or
           upgrading packages such as install, remove, safe-upgrade, full-upgrade. This can be useful to ensure a command
           always installs the latest versions, or, in combination with the --snapshot option to make sure the snapshot is
           present when install is being run.

           Caveat: Due to technical limitations, locks are acquired individually for each phase, hence an install may fail
           to acquire locks after successfully executing the update. Until this is resolved, this is merely syntactic
           sugar for apt update && apt install

       -h, --help
           Show a short usage summary.

       -v, --version
           Show the program version.

       -c, --config-file
           Configuration File; Specify a configuration file to use. The program will read the default configuration file
           and then this configuration file. If configuration settings need to be set before the default configuration
           files are parsed specify a file with the APT_CONFIG environment variable. See apt.conf(5) for syntax
           information.

       -o, --option
           Set a Configuration Option; This will set an arbitrary configuration option. The syntax is -o Foo::Bar=bar.  -o
           and --option can be used multiple times to set different options.

NAME
       apport-bug, apport-collect - file a bug report using Apport, or update an existing report

SYNOPSIS
       apport-bug

       apport-bug symptom | pid | package | program path | .apport/.crash file

       apport-collect report-number

DESCRIPTION
       apport-bug  reports problems to your distribution's bug tracking system, using Apport to collect a lot of local in‐
       formation about your system to help the developers to fix the problem and avoid unnecessary  question/answer  turn‐
       arounds.

       You  should  always  start  with running apport-bug without arguments, which will present a list of known symptoms.
       This will generate the most useful bug reports.

       If there is no matching symptom, you need to determine the affected program or package yourself. You can provide  a
       package name or program name to apport-bug, e. g.:

           apport-bug firefox
           apport-bug /usr/bin/unzip

       In  order to add more information to the bug report that could help the developers to fix the problem, you can also
       specify a process ID instead:

           $ pidof gnome-terminal
           5139
           $ apport-bug 5139

       As a special case, to report a bug against the Linux kernel, you do not need to use the full package name (such  as
       linux-image-2.6.28-4-generic); you can just use

           apport-bug linux

       to report a bug against the currently running kernel.

       Finally, you can use this program to report a previously stored crash or bug report:

           apport-bug /var/crash/_bin_bash.1000.crash
           apport-bug /tmp/apport.firefox.332G9t.apport

       Bug reports can be written to a file by using the --save option  or by using apport-cli.

       apport-bug  detects  whether  KDE or Gnome is running and calls apport-gtk or apport-kde accordingly. If neither is
       available, or the session does not run under X11, it calls apport-cli for a command-line client.

UPDATING EXISTING REPORTS
       apport-collect collects the same information as apport-bug, but adds it to an already  reported  problem  you  have
       submitted.  This is useful if the report was not originally filed through Apport, and the developers ask you to at‐
       tach information from your system.

OPTIONS
       Please see the apport-cli(1) manpage for possible options.

ENVIRONMENT
       APPORT_IGNORE_OBSOLETE_PACKAGES
              Apport refuses to create bug reports if the package or any dependency is not current.  If  this  environment
              variable  is  set, this check is waived. Experts who will thoroughly check the situation before filing a bug
              report can define this in their ~/.bashrc or temporarily on the command line when calling apport-bug.

FILES
       apport crash files are written in to /var/crash by default, named uniquely per binary name and user id.   They  are
       not  deleted  after  being sent to the bug tracker (but from cron when they get older than 7 days). You can extract
       the core file (if any) and other information using apport-unpack.

APT-KEY(8)                                                  APT                                                 APT-KEY(8)

NAME
       apt-key - Deprecated APT key management utility

SYNOPSIS

       apt-key [--keyring filename] {add filename | del keyid | export keyid | exportall | list | finger | adv | update |
               net-update | {-v | --version} | {-h | --help}}

DESCRIPTION
       apt-key is used to manage the list of keys used by apt to authenticate packages. Packages which have been
       authenticated using these keys will be considered trusted.

       Use of apt-key is deprecated, except for the use of apt-key del in maintainer scripts to remove existing keys from
       the main keyring. If such usage of apt-key is desired the additional installation of the GNU Privacy Guard suite
       (packaged in gnupg) is required.

       apt-key(8) will last be available in Debian 12 and Ubuntu 24.04.

SUPPORTED KEYRING FILES
       apt-key supports only the binary OpenPGP format (also known as "GPG key public ring") in files with the "gpg"
       extension, not the keybox database format introduced in newer gpg(1) versions as default for keyring files. Binary
       keyring files intended to be used with any apt version should therefore always be created with gpg --export.

       Alternatively, if all systems which should be using the created keyring have at least apt version >= 1.4 installed,
       you can use the ASCII armored format with the "asc" extension instead which can be created with gpg --armor
       --export.

COMMANDS
       add filename (deprecated)
           Add a new key to the list of trusted keys. The key is read from the filename given with the parameter filename
           or if the filename is - from standard input.

           It is critical that keys added manually via apt-key are verified to belong to the owner of the repositories
           they claim to be for otherwise the apt-secure(8) infrastructure is completely undermined.

           Note: Instead of using this command a keyring should be placed directly in the /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/
           directory with a descriptive name and either "gpg" or "asc" as file extension.

       del keyid (mostly deprecated)
           Remove a key from the list of trusted keys.

       export keyid (deprecated)
           Output the key keyid to standard output.

       exportall (deprecated)
           Output all trusted keys to standard output.

       list, finger (deprecated)
           List trusted keys with fingerprints.

       adv (deprecated)
           Pass advanced options to gpg. With adv --recv-key you can e.g. download key from keyservers directly into the
           trusted set of keys. Note that there are no checks performed, so it is easy to completely undermine the apt-
           secure(8) infrastructure if used without care.

       update (deprecated)
           Update the local keyring with the archive keyring and remove from the local keyring the archive keys which are
           no longer valid. The archive keyring is shipped in the archive-keyring package of your distribution, e.g. the
           ubuntu-keyring package in Ubuntu.

           Note that a distribution does not need to and in fact should not use this command any longer and instead ship
           keyring files in the /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/ directory directly as this avoids a dependency on gnupg and it is
           easier to manage keys by simply adding and removing files for maintainers and users alike.

       net-update (deprecated)
           Perform an update working similarly to the update command above, but get the archive keyring from a URI instead
           and validate it against a master key. This requires an installed wget(1) and an APT build configured to have a
           server to fetch from and a master keyring to validate. APT in Debian does not support this command, relying on
           update instead, but Ubuntu's APT does.

OPTIONS
       Note that options need to be defined before the commands described in the previous section.

       --keyring filename (deprecated)
           With this option it is possible to specify a particular keyring file the command should operate on. The default
           is that a command is executed on the trusted.gpg file as well as on all parts in the trusted.gpg.d directory,
           though trusted.gpg is the primary keyring which means that e.g. new keys are added to this one.

DEPRECATION
       Except for using apt-key del in maintainer scripts, the use of apt-key is deprecated. This section shows how to
       replace existing use of apt-key.

       If your existing use of apt-key add looks like this:

       wget -qO- https://myrepo.example/myrepo.asc | sudo apt-key add -

       Then you can directly replace this with (though note the recommendation below):

       wget -qO- https://myrepo.example/myrepo.asc | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/myrepo.asc

       Make sure to use the "asc" extension for ASCII armored keys and the "gpg" extension for the binary OpenPGP format
       (also known as "GPG key public ring"). The binary OpenPGP format works for all apt versions, while the ASCII
       armored format works for apt version >= 1.4.

       Recommended: Instead of placing keys into the /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d directory, you can place them anywhere on your
       filesystem by using the Signed-By option in your sources.list and pointing to the filename of the key. See
       sources.list(5) for details. Since APT 2.4, /etc/apt/keyrings is provided as the recommended location for keys not
       managed by packages. When using a deb822-style sources.list, and with apt version >= 2.4, the Signed-By option can
       also be used to include the full ASCII armored keyring directly in the sources.list without an additional file.

FILES
       /etc/apt/trusted.gpg
           Keyring of local trusted keys, new keys will be added here. Configuration Item: Dir::Etc::Trusted.

       /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/
           File fragments for the trusted keys, additional keyrings can be stored here (by other packages or the
           administrator). Configuration Item Dir::Etc::TrustedParts.

       /etc/apt/keyrings/
           Place to store additional keyrings to be used with Signed-By.

NAME
       aseqnet - ALSA sequencer connectors over network

SYNOPSIS
       aseqnet [remotehost]

DESCRIPTION
       aseqnet  is  an  ALSA sequencer client which sends and receives event packets over network.  Suppose two hosts con‐
       nected by network, hostA as a server and hostB as a client.  The ALSA sequencer system  must  be  running  on  both
       hosts.  For creating the server port, run the following on hostA:

           hostA% aseqnet
           sequencer opened: 128:0

       Then  a  user  client  128  with port 0 was opened on hostA.  (The client number may vary.)  For creating the (net‐
       work-)client port, run aseqnet with the hostname of the server:

           hostB% aseqnet hostA
           sequencer opened: 132:0

       Now all events sent to hostA:128:0 are transferred to hostB:132:0, and vice versa.

       The ports created by aseqnet can be connected arbitrary to other sequencer ports via aconnect(1).  For example,  to
       connect hostB:132:0 to a MIDI output device 65:0:

           hostB% aconnect 132:0 65:0

       Then events to hostA:128:0 will be delivered to hostB:65:0.  The following command plays MIDI on hostB.

           hostA% pmidi -p 128:0 foo.mid

       The  multiple clients may exist simultaneously.  If hostC is connected as a client to hostA, events from from hostA
       are sent to all connected network clients, i.e. hostB and hostC.  However, only one connection is  allowed  from  a
       client to a server.

       To  disconnect  network, stop all clients before server by ctrl-C or sending signal to them.  The server will auto‐
       matically quit.

OPTIONS
       -p port
              Specify the TCP port number or TCP service name.

       -s addr
              Subscribe to the given address for read automatically.

       -d addr
              Subscribe to the given address for write automatically.

       -n name
              Specify the midi name of the process.

       -v     Verbose mode.

ALSACTL(1)                                        General Commands Manual                                       ALSACTL(1)

NAME
       alsactl - advanced controls for ALSA soundcard driver

SYNOPSIS
       alsactl [options] [store|restore|init] <card # or id or device>

       alsactl monitor <card # or id>

       alsactl info <card # or id>

       alsactl [clean] <card # or id or device> [[control identifiers]]

DESCRIPTION
       alsactl  is  used  to control advanced settings for the ALSA soundcard drivers. It supports multiple soundcards. If
       your card has features that you can't seem to control from a mixer application, you have come to the right place.

COMMANDS
   Introduction
       The <card> argument is optional. If no soundcards are specified, setup for all cards will be saved, loaded or moni‐
       tored.

   store <card>
       This command saves the current driver state for the selected soundcard to the configuration file.

   restore <card>
       This command loads driver state for the selected soundcard from the configuration file. If restoring fails (eventu‐
       ally partly), the init action is called.

   nrestore <card>
       This command is like restore, but it notifies also the daemon to do new rescan for available soundcards.

   init <card>
       This command tries to initialize all devices to a default state. If device is not known, error code 99 is returned.

   daemon
       This command manages to save periodically the sound state.

   rdaemon
       This command is like daemon but restore the sound state at first.

   kill <cmd>
       This command notifies the daemon to do the specified operation (quit, rescan, save_and_quit).

   monitor <card>
       This command is for monitoring the events received from the given control device.

   info <card>
       This command shows the general information in the YAML format collected from the given control device (sound card).

   clean <card> [filter]
       This command cleans the controls created by applications.

       The optional element identifiers are accepted as a filter. One extra argument is parsed as an element identifiers.

       Example: alsactl clean 0 "name='PCM'" "name='Mic Phantom'"

   dump-state
       This command dumps the current state (all cards) to stdout.

   dump-cfg
       This command dumps the current configuration (all cards) to stdout.  Note that the configuration hooks  are  evalu‐
       ated.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Help: show available flags and commands.

       -d, --debug
              Use debug mode: a bit more verbose.

       -v, --version
              Print alsactl version number.

       -f, --file
              Select the configuration file to use. The default is /var/lib/alsa/asound.state.

       -a, --config-dir
              Select the boot / hotplug ALSA configuration directory to use. The default is /var/lib/alsa.

       -l, --lock
              Use  the  file  locking to serialize the concurrent access to the state file (this option is default for the
              global state file).

       -L, --no-lock
              Do not use the file locking to serialize the concurrent access to the state file (including the global state
              file).

       -O, --lock-state-file
              Select the state lock file path.

       -F, --force
              Used with restore command.  Try to restore the matching control elements as much as possible.   This  option
              is set as default now.

       -g, --ignore
              Used  with  store, restore and init commands. Do not show 'No soundcards found' and do not set an error exit
              code when soundcards are not installed.

       -P, --pedantic
              Used with restore command.  Don't restore mismatching control elements.  This option was the old default be‐
              havior.

       -I, --no-init-fallback
              Don't initialize cards if restore fails.  Since version 1.0.18, alsactl tries to initialize  the  card  with
              the  restore  operation  as default.  But this can cause incompatibility with the older version.  The caller
              may expect that the state won't be touched if no state file exists.  This option takes the restore  behavior
              back to the older version by suppressing the initialization.

       -r, --runstate
              Save  restore  and init state to this file. The file will contain only errors.  Errors are appended with the
              soundcard id to the end of file.

       -R, --remove
              Remove runstate file at first.

       -E, --env #=#
              Set environment variable (useful for init action or you may override ALSA_CONFIG_PATH to read  different  or
              optimized configuration - may be useful for "boot" scripts).

       -i, --initfile
              The configuration file for init. By default, PREFIX/share/alsa/init/00main is used.

       -p, --period
              The store period in seconds for the daemon command.

       -e, --pid-file
              The pathname to store the process-id file in the HDB UUCP format (ASCII).

       -b, --background
              Run the task in background.

       -s, --syslog
              Use syslog for messages.

       -n, --nice
              Set the process priority (see 'man nice')

       -c, --sched-idle
              Set the process scheduling policy to idle (SCHED_IDLE).

       -D, --ucm-defaults
              Execute  also  the  'defaults' section from the UCM configuration. The standard behaviour is to execute only
              'once' section.

       -U, --no-ucm
              Skip the UCM init even if available. It may be useful for the test the legacy init configuration.

FILES
       /var/lib/alsa/asound.state (or whatever file you specify with the -f flag) is used to store  current  settings  for
       your soundcards. The settings include all the usual soundcard mixer settings.  More importantly, alsactl is capable
       of controlling other card-specific features that mixer apps usually don't know about.

       The  configuration file is generated automatically by running alsactl store. Editing the configuration file by hand
       may be necessary for some soundcard features (e.g. enabling/disabling automatic  mic  gain,  digital  output,  joy‐
       stick/game ports, some future MIDI routing options, etc).

apport-cli(1)                                     General Commands Manual                                    apport-cli(1)

NAME
       apport-cli, apport-gtk, apport-kde - Apport user interfaces for reporting problems

SYNOPSIS
       apport-cli

       apport-cli [ --save file ] symptom | pid | package | program path | .apport/.crash file

       apport-cli -f

       apport-cli -f -p package -P pid

       apport-cli -u report-number

       Same options/arguments for apport-gtk and apport-kde.

DESCRIPTION
       apport  automatically  collects data from crashed processes and compiles a problem report in /var/crash/. This is a
       command line frontend for reporting those crashes to the developers. It can also be used to report bugs about pack‐
       ages or running processes.

       If symptom scripts are available, it can also be given the name of a symptom, or be called with just -f to  display
       a list of known symptoms.

       When being called without any options, it processes the pending crash reports and offers to report them one by one.
       You can also display the entire report to see what is sent to the software developers.

       When  being  called  with exactly one argument and no option, apport-cli uses some heuristics to find out "what you
       mean" and reports a bug against the given symptom name, package name, program path, or PID. If the  argument  is  a
       .crash or .apport file, it uploads the stored problem report to the bug tracking system.

       For  desktop  systems with a graphical user interface, you should consider installing the GTK or KDE user interface
       (apport-gtk or apport-kde). They accept the very same options and arguments.  apport-cli is mainly intended  to  be
       used on servers.

OPTIONS
       -f, --file-bug
              Report  a  (non-crash)  problem. If neither --package, --symptom, or --pid are specified, then it displays a
              list of available symptoms. If none are available, it aborts with an error.

              This will automatically attach information about your operating system and the package version etc.  to  the
              bug report, so that the developers have some important context.

       -s symptom, --symptom=symptom
              When being used in --file-bug mode, specify the symptom to report the problem about.

       -p package, --package=package
              When being used in --file-bug mode, specify the package to report the problem against.

       -P pid, --pid=pid
              When  being used in --file-bug mode, specify the PID (process ID) of a running program to report the problem
              against. This can be determined with e. g.  ps -ux.

       -c report, --crash-file=report
              Upload a previously processed stored report in an arbitrary file location.  This is  useful  for  copying  a
              crash  report to a machine with internet connection and reporting it from there. Files must end in .crash or
              .apport.

       -u report-number, --update-report report-number
              Run apport information collection on an already existing problem report. The affected package is taken  from
              the  report  by default, but you can explicitly specify one with --package to collect information for a dif‐
              ferent package (this is useful if the report is assigned to the wrong package).

       --save filename
              In --file-bug mode, save the collected information into a file instead of reporting it. This file  can  then
              be reported with --crash-file later on.

       -w, --window
              Point  and  click  at the application window against which you wish to report the bug. Apport will automati‐
              cally find the package name and generate a report for you. This option can be specially useful in situations
              when you do not know the name of the package, or if the application window has stopped  responding  and  you
              cannot report the problem from the "Help" menu of the application.

              This option is not supported on Wayland. Users running Wayland should use another option such as -P to spec‐
              ify the application.

ENVIRONMENT
       APPORT_IGNORE_OBSOLETE_PACKAGES
              Apport  refuses  to  create bug reports if the package or any dependency is not current. If this environment
              variable is set, this check is waived. Experts who will thoroughly check the situation before filing  a  bug
              report  can  define  this in their ~/.bashrc or temporarily when calling the apport frontend (-cli, -gtk, or
              -kde).

FILES
       /usr/share/apport/symptoms/*.py
              Symptom scripts. These ask a set of interactive questions to determine the package which is responsible  for
              a  particular  problem.  (For  some problems like sound or storage device related bugs there are many places
              where things can go wrong, and it's not immediately obvious for a bug reporter where the problem is.)

APT-MARK(8)                                                 APT                                                APT-MARK(8)

NAME
       apt-mark - show, set and unset various settings for a package

SYNOPSIS

       apt-mark {-f=filename | {auto | manual} pkg...  | {showauto | showmanual} [pkg...] } | {-v | --version} |
                {-h | --help}

       apt-mark {hold | unhold | install | remove | purge} pkg...  |
                {showhold | showinstall | showremove | showpurge} [pkg...]

DESCRIPTION
       apt-mark can be used as a unified front-end to set various settings for a package, such as marking a package as
       being automatically/manually installed or changing dpkg selections such as hold, install, deinstall and purge which
       are respected e.g. by apt-get dselect-upgrade or aptitude.

AUTOMATICALLY AND MANUALLY INSTALLED PACKAGES
       When you request that a package is installed, and as a result other packages are installed to satisfy its
       dependencies, the dependencies are marked as being automatically installed, while the package you installed
       explicitly is marked as manually installed. Once an automatically installed package is no longer depended on by any
       manually installed package it is considered no longer needed and e.g.  apt-get or aptitude will at least suggest
       removing them.

       auto
           auto is used to mark a package as being automatically installed, which will cause the package to be removed
           when no more manually installed packages depend on this package.

       manual
           manual is used to mark a package as being manually installed, which will prevent the package from being
           automatically removed if no other packages depend on it.

       minimize-manual
           minimize-manual is used to mark (transitive) dependencies of metapackages as automatically installed. This can
           be used after an installation for example, to minimize the number of manually installed packages; or
           continuously on systems managed by system configuration metapackages.

       showauto
           showauto is used to print a list of automatically installed packages with each package on a new line. All
           automatically installed packages will be listed if no package is given. If packages are given only those which
           are automatically installed will be shown.

       showmanual
           showmanual can be used in the same way as showauto except that it will print a list of manually installed
           packages instead.

   Options
       -f=filename, --file=filename
           Read/Write package stats from the filename given with the parameter filename instead of from the default
           location, which is extended_states in the directory defined by the Configuration Item: Dir::State.

PREVENT CHANGES FOR A PACKAGE
       hold
           hold is used to mark a package as held back, which will prevent the package from being automatically installed,
           upgraded or removed.

       unhold
           unhold is used to cancel a previously set hold on a package to allow all actions again.

       showhold
           showhold is used to print a list of packages on hold in the same way as for the other show commands.

SCHEDULE PACKAGES FOR INSTALL, REMOVE AND PURGE
       Some front-ends like apt-get dselect-upgrade can be used to apply previously scheduled changes to the install state
       of packages. Such changes can be scheduled with the install, remove (also known as deinstall) and purge commands.
       Packages with a specific selection can be displayed with showinstall, showremove and showpurge respectively. More
       information about these so called dpkg selections can be found in dpkg(1).

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
           Show a short usage summary.

       -v, --version
           Show the program version.

       -c, --config-file
           Configuration File; Specify a configuration file to use. The program will read the default configuration file
           and then this configuration file. If configuration settings need to be set before the default configuration
           files are parsed specify a file with the APT_CONFIG environment variable. See apt.conf(5) for syntax
           information.

       -o, --option
           Set a Configuration Option; This will set an arbitrary configuration option. The syntax is -o Foo::Bar=bar.  -o
           and --option can be used multiple times to set different options.

FILES
       /var/lib/apt/extended_states
           Status list of auto-installed packages. Configuration Item: Dir::State::extended_states.

DIAGNOSTICS
       apt-mark returns zero on normal operation, non-zero on error.

ASPELL(1)                                    Aspell Abbreviated User's Manual                                    ASPELL(1)

NAME
       aspell - interactive spell checker

SYNOPSIS
       aspell [options] <command>

DESCRIPTION
       aspell  is  a  utility program that connects to the Aspell library so that it can function as an ispell -a replace‐
       ment, as an independent spell checker, as a test utility to test out Aspell library features, and as a utility  for
       managing dictionaries used by the library.

       The  Aspell  library contains an interface allowing other programs direct access to its functions and therefore re‐
       ducing the complex task of spell checking to simple library calls.  The default library does not contain dictionary
       word lists.  To add language dictionaries, please check your distro first for modified dictionaries, otherwise look
       here for base language dictionaries <http://aspell.net>.

       The following information describes the commands and options used by the Aspell Utility.

       This manual page is maintained separately from the official documentation so it may be out of date  or  incomplete.
       The  official  documentation  is  maintained as a Texinfo manual.  See the `aspell' entry in info for more complete
       documentation.

DICTIONARY OPTIONS
       The following options may be used to control which dictionaries to use and how they behave.

       --master=<name>, -d <name>
              Base name of the dictionary to use.  If this option is specified then Aspell will either use this dictionary
              or die.

       --dict-dir=<directory>
              Location of the main dictionary word list.

       --lang=<string>, -l <string>
              Language to use.  It follows the same format of the LANG environmental variable on most  systems.   It  con‐
              sists  of the two letter ISO 639 language code and an optional two letter ISO 3166 country code after a dash
              or underscore.  The default value is based on the value of the LC_MESSAGES locale.

       --size=<string>
              The preferred size of the dictionary word list.  This consists of a two char digit code describing the  size
              of the list, with typical values of: 10=tiny, 20=really small, 30=small, 40=med-small, 50=med, 60=med-large,

       --variety=<string>
              Any  extra  information to distinguish this variety of dictionary from other dictionaries which may have the
              same lang and size.

       --jargon=<string>
              Please use the variety option since it replaces jargon as a better choice.  jargon will be  removed  in  the
              future.

MISC OPTIONS
       Miscellaneous options that don't fall under any other category.

       --conf=<file name>
              Main configuration file.  This file overrides Aspell's global defaults.

       --conf-dir=<directory>
              Location of main configuration file.

       --data-dir=<directory>
              Location of language data files.

       --keyboard=<keyboard>
              Use this keyboard layout for suggesting possible words.  These spelling errors happen if a user accidentally
              presses a key next to the intended correct key.

       --local-data-dir=<directory>
              Alternative location of language data files.  This directory is searched before data-dir.

       --home-dir=<directory>
              Directory Location for personal wordlist files.

       --per-conf=<file name>
              Personal configuration file.  This file overrides options found in the global config file.

ASPELL UTILITY OPTIONS
       These options are part of the aspell Utility and work independently of the library.

       --backup, --dont-backup, -b, -x
              The aspell utility creates a backup file by making a copy and appending .bak to file name.   This  only  ap‐
              plies  when  the  command  is check <file> and the backup file is only created if any spelling modifications
              take place.

       --byte-offsets, --dont-byte-offsets
              Use byte offsets instead of character offsets.

       --guess, --dont-guess, -m, -P
              Create missing root/affix combinations not in the dictionary in pipe mode.

       --keymapping=aspell, --keymapping=ispell
              The keymapping to use, either aspell for the default mapping or ispell to use the same mapping that the  Is‐
              pell utility uses.

       --reverse, --dont-reverse
              Reverse the order of the suggestions list in pipe mode.

       --suggest, --dont-suggest
              Suggest possible replacements in pipe mode.  If false, Aspell will simply report the misspelling and make no
              attempt at suggestions or possible corrections.

       --time, --dont-time
              Time the load time and suggest a time in pipe mode.

       In addition Aspell will try to make sense out of Ispell's command line options so that it can function as a drop in
       replacement  for Ispell.  If Aspell is run without any command line options it will display a brief help screen and
       quit.

CONFIGURATION
       Aspell can accept options via global or personal configuration files so that you do not need to specify  them  each
       time  at  the command line.  The default global configuration file is /etc/aspell.conf or another file specified by
       option --conf and is checked first.  The default per user configuration file ~/.aspell.conf located  in  the  $HOME
       directory  (or another file specified by option --per-conf) is checked next and overrides options set in the global
       config file.  Options specified at either the command line or via an environmental variable override  those  speci‐
       fied by either configuration file.

       Each line of the configuration file has the format:

              option [value]

       where  option is any one of the standard library options above without the leading dashes.  For example the follow‐
       ing line will set the default language to Swiss German:

              lang de_CH

       There may be any number of spaces between the option and the value, however it can only be spaces, i.e. there is no
       '=' between the option name and the value.  Comments may also be included by preceding them with a '#' as  anything
       from  a '#' to a newline is ignored.  Blank lines are also allowed.  The /etc/aspell.conf file is a good example of
       how to set these options and the Aspell Manual has more detailed info.

aconnect(1)                                       General Commands Manual                                      aconnect(1)

NAME
       aconnect - ALSA sequencer connection manager

SYNOPSIS
       aconnect [-d] [-options] sender receiver
       aconnect -i|-o [-options]
       aconnect -x

DESCRIPTION
       aconnect  is  a  utility to connect and disconnect two existing ports on ALSA sequencer system.  The ports with the
       arbitrary subscription permission, such as created by aseqview(1), can be connected to any (MIDI) device ports  us‐
       ing aconnect.  For example, to connect from port 64:0 to 65:0, run as follows:

           % aconnect 64:0 65:0

       The  connection is one-way, and the whole data to the sender port (64:0) is redirected to the receiver port (65:0).
       When another port (e.g. 65:1) is attached to the same sender port, the data is sent to both  receiver  ports.   For
       disconnection, use -d option.

       % aconnect -d 64:0 65:0

       The address can be given using the client's name.

       % aconnect External:0 Emu8000:1

       Then the port 0 of the client matching with the string "External" is connected to the port 1 of the client matching
       with the "Emu8000".

       Another  function  of aconnect is to list the present ports on the given condition.  The input ports, which may be‐
       come sender ports, can be listed with -i option.

       % aconnect -i
       client 0: 'System' [type=kernel]
           0 'Timer           '
           1 'Announce        '
       client 64: 'External MIDI-0' [type=kernel]
           0 'MIDI 0-0        '

       Similarly, to see the output ports, use -o flag.

       You can remove all existing exported connections using -x option.  This function is useful for terminating the ALSA
       drivers, because the modules with sequencer connections cannot be unloaded unless their connections are removed.

OPTIONS
   CONNECTION MANAGEMENT
       -d, --disconnect
              Disconnect the given subscription.

       -e, --exclusive
              Connect ports with exclusive mode.  Both sender and receiver ports can be no longer connected by  any  other
              ports.

       -r, --real queue
              Convert  time-stamps of event packets to the current value of the given real-time queue.  This is option is,
              however, not so useful, since the receiver port must use (not necessarily own) the specified queue.

       -t, --tick queue
              Like -r option, but time-stamps are converted to the current value of the given tick queue.

   LIST PORTS
       -i, --input
              List existing input (readable) ports.  This option is exclusive to -o.

       -o, --output
              List existing output (writable) ports.  This option is exclusive to -i.

       -l, --list
              List the current connection status.  The connected and connecting ports from/to each  port  are  listed  to‐
              gether.  The suffix flag [ex] means the connection is exclusive.  The suffix flag [real:#] and [tick:#] mean
              the connection includes real-time and tick conversion on the listed queue, respectively.

   REMOVE ALL CONNECTIONS
       -x, --removeall
              Remove all exported connections.

apport-bug(1)                                     General Commands Manual                                    apport-bug(1)

NAME
       apport-bug, apport-collect - file a bug report using Apport, or update an existing report

SYNOPSIS
       apport-bug

       apport-bug symptom | pid | package | program path | .apport/.crash file

       apport-collect report-number

DESCRIPTION
       apport-bug  reports problems to your distribution's bug tracking system, using Apport to collect a lot of local in‐
       formation about your system to help the developers to fix the problem and avoid unnecessary  question/answer  turn‐
       arounds.

       You  should  always  start  with running apport-bug without arguments, which will present a list of known symptoms.
       This will generate the most useful bug reports.

       If there is no matching symptom, you need to determine the affected program or package yourself. You can provide  a
       package name or program name to apport-bug, e. g.:

           apport-bug firefox
           apport-bug /usr/bin/unzip

       In  order to add more information to the bug report that could help the developers to fix the problem, you can also
       specify a process ID instead:

           $ pidof gnome-terminal
           5139
           $ apport-bug 5139

       As a special case, to report a bug against the Linux kernel, you do not need to use the full package name (such  as
       linux-image-2.6.28-4-generic); you can just use

           apport-bug linux

       to report a bug against the currently running kernel.

       Finally, you can use this program to report a previously stored crash or bug report:

           apport-bug /var/crash/_bin_bash.1000.crash
           apport-bug /tmp/apport.firefox.332G9t.apport

       Bug reports can be written to a file by using the --save option  or by using apport-cli.

       apport-bug  detects  whether  KDE or Gnome is running and calls apport-gtk or apport-kde accordingly. If neither is
       available, or the session does not run under X11, it calls apport-cli for a command-line client.

UPDATING EXISTING REPORTS
       apport-collect collects the same information as apport-bug, but adds it to an already  reported  problem  you  have
       submitted.  This is useful if the report was not originally filed through Apport, and the developers ask you to at‐
       tach information from your system.

OPTIONS
       Please see the apport-cli(1) manpage for possible options.

ENVIRONMENT
       APPORT_IGNORE_OBSOLETE_PACKAGES
              Apport refuses to create bug reports if the package or any dependency is not current.  If  this  environment
              variable  is  set, this check is waived. Experts who will thoroughly check the situation before filing a bug
              report can define this in their ~/.bashrc or temporarily on the command line when calling apport-bug.

FILES
       apport crash files are written in to /var/crash by default, named uniquely per binary name and user id.   They  are
       not  deleted  after  being sent to the bug tracker (but from cron when they get older than 7 days). You can extract
       the core file (if any) and other information using apport-unpack.

NAME
       apt-sortpkgs - Utility to sort package index files

SYNOPSIS

       apt-sortpkgs [-s] [-o=config_string] [-c=config_file] filename... {-v | --version} {-h | --help}

DESCRIPTION
       apt-sortpkgs will take an index file (source index or package index) and sort the records so that they are ordered
       by the package name. It will also sort the internal fields of each record according to the internal sorting rules.

       All output is sent to standard output; the input must be a seekable file.

OPTIONS
       All command line options may be set using the configuration file, the descriptions indicate the configuration
       option to set. For boolean options you can override the config file by using something like -f-,--no-f, -f=no or
       several other variations.

       -s, --source
           Use source index field ordering. Configuration Item: APT::SortPkgs::Source.

       -h, --help
           Show a short usage summary.

       -v, --version
           Show the program version.

       -c, --config-file
           Configuration File; Specify a configuration file to use. The program will read the default configuration file
           and then this configuration file. If configuration settings need to be set before the default configuration
           files are parsed specify a file with the APT_CONFIG environment variable. See apt.conf(5) for syntax
           information.

       -o, --option
           Set a Configuration Option; This will set an arbitrary configuration option. The syntax is -o Foo::Bar=bar.  -o
           and --option can be used multiple times to set different options.

NAME
       aspell-autobuildhash - Autobuilding aspell hash files for some dicts

SYNOPSIS
        aspell-autobuildhash [--force]

          Options:
           --debug      Show extra info about aspell-autobuildhash internal
                        work. Will also enable aspell affix validation.
           --dry-run    Show what would be done, but do nothing real.
           --force      Rebuild the hash file for all dicts providing a
                        compat file skipping the test.
           --triggered  Tell the script that is run in the triggers stage.

DESCRIPTION
       aspell-autobuildhash is a script that will manage aspell hash files autobuild, intended to be called from the
       dictionaries-common tools.  Depending on the aspell compatibility level and on the compatibility level used for the
       hash file if present, will decide whether it must be rebuilt or not. This script will only work on aspell packages
       prepared to use it, it will do nothing for other aspell dict packages.

OPTIONS
        --debug      Show some extra information about aspell-autobuildhash
                     internal work. Will also enable aspell affix validation.
        --dry-run    Show what would be done, but do nothing real.
        --force      Rebuild the hash file for all dicts providing a compat
                     file regardless of the compatibility levels found.
        --triggered  Tell the script that is run in the triggers stage. When
                     run under dpkg control, do not try to set the
                     'aspell-autobuildhash' trigger, but run real
                     B<aspell-autobuildhash> code. When not run under dpkg
                     control, real code will always be run and '--triggered'
                     option has no real effect.

PACKAGE MAINTAINERS
       To use this system, aspell-autobuildhash expects a $lang.compat file in /var/lib/aspell ($lang stands for the lang
       basename with variant if any, e.g. $lang is something like gl-minimos or en)) containing aspell compatibility
       version for last successful build or "0" or en empty file if hash is to be rebuild, as is for dictionary
       installation and upgrades.

       When upgrading aspell, script will check if version in $lang.compat is different from aspell.compat and rebuild if
       so, updating $lang.compat with the new value.

       Wordlists should previously be compressed either with gzip (and their extensions set as .mwl.gz or .wl.gz) or
       preferably first with aspell prezip and then gzipped (with .cwl.gz extension).  This applies both for plain
       wordlists and munched wordlists (in the ispell way) if you use affix compression.

       If your package will provide a single hash, install prezipped+gzipped wordlist as /usr/share/aspell/$lang.cwl.gz
       or, if prezip is not used, as /usr/share/aspell/$lang.mwl.gz.

       If your package will provide more than one aspell hash for the same $lang, you will need to place each compressed
       wordlist as e.g.  /usr/share/aspell/$subdict.cwl.gz, and the common $lang.compat as above. Then create a
       /usr/share/aspell/$lang.contents file with the base names of the subdicts, one in a line. For English that will
       contain, amongst other possible lines

        en-common
        en-variant_0
        en-variant_1
        en-variant_2
        en_CA-w_accents-only

       No need to use this file if a single hash is being created.

       Dictionaries-common scripts will call internally this script and create a single hash file at
       /var/lib/ispell/$lang.rws, or hash files at /var/lib/ispell/$subdict.rws. You must set a symlink to that files from
       /usr/lib/aspell/$lang.rws or /usr/lib/aspell/$subdict.rws as appropriate.

       Aspell dictionary packages using this script must make sure that $lang.compat is reset on every new
       install/upgrade, so hash is rebuilt.  They must also make sure that $lang.compat and all of
       /var/lib/aspell/$lang.rws or /var/lib/aspell/$subdict.rws are removed on package removal.

       As of version 1.10, installdeb-aspell script will understand 'auto-compat' and 'auto-contents' fields in
       $dict.info-aspell file to help with this by adding needed debhelper snippets.  Put in that entry the base name(s)
       of your compat and contents file(s) and carefully check resulting maintainer scripts after build.

       Note that you are no longer suggested to ship empty files at any of /var/lib/aspell/$lang.compat,
       /var/lib/aspell/$lang.rws or /var/lib/aspell/$subdict.rws, but explicitly create/update them on install and
       explicitly remove them on removal.

       aspell maintainer should also call this script from package postinst.  When comparing versions it will get the
       aspell version from file /usr/share/aspell/aspell.compat.

NAME
       apport-unpack - extract the fields of a problem report to separate files

SYNOPSIS
       apport-unpack report target-directory

DESCRIPTION
       A  problem  report, as produced by apport is a single file with a set of key/value pairs in the RFC822 syntax. This
       tool disassembles a report such that the value of each entry is written into a separate file, with the key as  file
       name. This is particularly useful for large binary data like the core dump.

       report is either a path to an existing apport crash report, or '-' to read from stdin.

       The target-directory must either be nonexisting or empty.

AR(1)                                              GNU Development Tools                                             AR(1)

NAME
       ar - create, modify, and extract from archives

SYNOPSIS
       ar [-X32_64] [-]p[mod] [--plugin name] [--target bfdname] [--output dirname] [--record-libdeps libdeps] [--thin]
       [relpos] [count] archive [member...]

DESCRIPTION
       The GNU ar program creates, modifies, and extracts from archives.  An archive is a single file holding a collection
       of other files in a structure that makes it possible to retrieve the original individual files (called members of
       the archive).

       The original files' contents, mode (permissions), timestamp, owner, and group are preserved in the archive, and can
       be restored on extraction.

       GNU ar can maintain archives whose members have names of any length; however, depending on how ar is configured on
       your system, a limit on member-name length may be imposed for compatibility with archive formats maintained with
       other tools.  If it exists, the limit is often 15 characters (typical of formats related to a.out) or 16 characters
       (typical of formats related to coff).

       ar is considered a binary utility because archives of this sort are most often used as libraries holding commonly
       needed subroutines.  Since libraries often will depend on other libraries, ar can also record the dependencies of a
       library when the --record-libdeps option is specified.

       ar creates an index to the symbols defined in relocatable object modules in the archive when you specify the
       modifier s.  Once created, this index is updated in the archive whenever ar makes a change to its contents (save
       for the q update operation).  An archive with such an index speeds up linking to the library, and allows routines
       in the library to call each other without regard to their placement in the archive.

       You may use nm -s or nm --print-armap to list this index table.  If an archive lacks the table, another form of ar
       called ranlib can be used to add just the table.

       GNU ar can optionally create a thin archive, which contains a symbol index and references to the original copies of
       the member files of the archive.  This is useful for building libraries for use within a local build tree, where
       the relocatable objects are expected to remain available, and copying the contents of each object would only waste
       time and space.

       An archive can either be thin or it can be normal.  It cannot be both at the same time.  Once an archive is created
       its format cannot be changed without first deleting it and then creating a new archive in its place.

       Thin archives are also flattened, so that adding one thin archive to another thin archive does not nest it, as
       would happen with a normal archive.  Instead the elements of the first archive are added individually to the second
       archive.

       The paths to the elements of the archive are stored relative to the archive itself.

       GNU ar is designed to be compatible with two different facilities.  You can control its activity using command-line
       options, like the different varieties of ar on Unix systems; or, if you specify the single command-line option -M,
       you can control it with a script supplied via standard input, like the MRI "librarian" program.

OPTIONS
       GNU ar allows you to mix the operation code p and modifier flags mod in any order, within the first command-line
       argument.

       If you wish, you may begin the first command-line argument with a dash.

       The p keyletter specifies what operation to execute; it may be any of the following, but you must specify only one
       of them:

       d   Delete  modules  from  the  archive.   Specify  the names of modules to be deleted as member...; the archive is
           untouched if you specify no files to delete.

           If you specify the v modifier, ar lists each module as it is deleted.

       m   Use this operation to move members in an archive.

           The ordering of members in an archive can make a difference in how programs are linked using the library, if  a
           symbol is defined in more than one member.

           If  no  modifiers  are  used with "m", any members you name in the member arguments are moved to the end of the
           archive; you can use the a, b, or i modifiers to move them to a specified place instead.

       p   Print the specified members of the archive, to the standard output file.  If the v modifier is specified,  show
           the member name before copying its contents to standard output.

           If you specify no member arguments, all the files in the archive are printed.

       q   Quick append; Historically, add the files member... to the end of archive, without checking for replacement.

           The  modifiers  a,  b,  and  i  do  not  affect this operation; new members are always placed at the end of the
           archive.

           The modifier v makes ar list each file as it is appended.

           Since the point of this operation is speed, implementations of ar have the option of not updating the archive's
           symbol table if one exists.  Too many different systems however assume that symbol  tables  are  always  up-to-
           date, so GNU ar will rebuild the table even with a quick append.

           Note  -  GNU  ar treats the command qs as a synonym for r - replacing already existing files in the archive and
           appending new ones at the end.

       r   Insert the files member... into archive  (with  replacement).  This  operation  differs  from  q  in  that  any
           previously existing members are deleted if their names match those being added.

           If one of the files named in member... does not exist, ar displays an error message, and leaves undisturbed any
           existing members of the archive matching that name.

           By  default,  new  members are added at the end of the file; but you may use one of the modifiers a, b, or i to
           request placement relative to some existing member.

           The modifier v used with this operation elicits a line of output for each file inserted, along with one of  the
           letters a or r to indicate whether the file was appended (no old member deleted) or replaced.

       s   Add  an index to the archive, or update it if it already exists.  Note this command is an exception to the rule
           that there can only be one command letter, as it is possible to use it as either a command or a  modifier.   In
           either case it does the same thing.

       t   Display  a table listing the contents of archive, or those of the files listed in member... that are present in
           the archive.  Normally only the  member  name  is  shown,  but  if  the  modifier  O  is  specified,  then  the
           corresponding  offset  of  the  member  is  also  displayed.  Finally, in order to see the modes (permissions),
           timestamp, owner, group, and size the v modifier should be included.

           If you do not specify a member, all files in the archive are listed.

           If there is more than one file with the same name (say, fie) in an archive (say b.a), ar t b.a fie  lists  only
           the first instance; to see them all, you must ask for a complete listing---in our example, ar t b.a.

       x   Extract  members  (named  member) from the archive.  You can use the v modifier with this operation, to request
           that ar list each name as it extracts it.

           If you do not specify a member, all files in the archive are extracted.

           Files cannot be extracted from a thin archive, and there are restrictions on extracting from  archives  created
           with  P:  The paths must not be absolute, may not contain "..", and any subdirectories in the paths must exist.
           If it is desired to avoid these restrictions then used the --output option to specify an output directory.

       A number of modifiers (mod) may immediately follow the  p  keyletter,  to  specify  variations  on  an  operation's
       behavior:

       a   Add  new  files  after  an  existing member of the archive.  If you use the modifier a, the name of an existing
           archive member must be present as the relpos argument, before the archive specification.

       b   Add new files before an existing member of the archive.  If you use the modifier b, the  name  of  an  existing
           archive member must be present as the relpos argument, before the archive specification.  (same as i).

       c   Create  the  archive.  The specified archive is always created if it did not exist, when you request an update.
           But a warning is issued unless you specify in advance that you expect to create it, by using this modifier.

       D   Operate in deterministic mode.  When adding files and the archive index use zero for  UIDs,  GIDs,  timestamps,
           and  use  consistent  file modes for all files.  When this option is used, if ar is used with identical options
           and identical input files, multiple runs will create identical output files  regardless  of  the  input  files'
           owners, groups, file modes, or modification times.

           If  binutils  was  configured with --enable-deterministic-archives, then this mode is on by default.  It can be
           disabled with the U modifier, below.

       f   Truncate names in the archive.  GNU ar will normally permit file names of any length.  This will  cause  it  to
           create archives which are not compatible with the native ar program on some systems.  If this is a concern, the
           f modifier may be used to truncate file names when putting them in the archive.

       i   Insert  new files before an existing member of the archive.  If you use the modifier i, the name of an existing
           archive member must be present as the relpos argument, before the archive specification.  (same as b).

       l   Specify dependencies of this library.  The dependencies must immediately follow this option character, must use
           the same syntax as the linker command line, and must be specified within a single argument.  I.e., if  multiple
           items  are needed, they must be quoted to form a single command line argument.  For example L "-L/usr/local/lib
           -lmydep1 -lmydep2"

       N   Uses the count parameter.  This is used if there are multiple entries  in  the  archive  with  the  same  name.
           Extract or delete instance count of the given name from the archive.

       o   Preserve  the  original  dates  of  members  when  extracting them.  If you do not specify this modifier, files
           extracted from the archive are stamped with the time of extraction.

       O   Display member offsets inside the archive. Use together with the t option.

       P   Use the full path name when matching or storing names in the archive.  Archives created with  full  path  names
           are  not  POSIX  compliant,  and  thus may not work with tools other than up to date GNU tools.  Modifying such
           archives with GNU ar without using P will remove the full path names unless the  archive  is  a  thin  archive.
           Note  that P may be useful when adding files to a thin archive since r without P ignores the path when choosing
           which element to replace.  Thus

                   ar rcST archive.a subdir/file1 subdir/file2 file1

           will result in the first "subdir/file1" being replaced with "file1" from the current directory.  Adding P  will
           prevent this replacement.

       s   Write  an object-file index into the archive, or update an existing one, even if no other change is made to the
           archive.  You may use this modifier flag either with any operation, or alone.  Running ar s on  an  archive  is
           equivalent to running ranlib on it.

       S   Do  not  generate  an  archive symbol table.  This can speed up building a large library in several steps.  The
           resulting archive can not be used with the linker.  In order to build a symbol  table,  you  must  omit  the  S
           modifier on the last execution of ar, or you must run ranlib on the archive.

       T   Deprecated  alias  for  --thin.   T  is  not  recommended  because in many ar implementations T has a different
           meaning, as specified by X/Open System Interface.

       u   Normally, ar r... inserts all files listed into the archive.  If you would like to insert  only  those  of  the
           files  you  list  that are newer than existing members of the same names, use this modifier.  The u modifier is
           allowed only for the operation r (replace).  In particular, the combination qu is not allowed,  since  checking
           the timestamps would lose any speed advantage from the operation q.

           Note  -  if  an  archive  has  been  created  in a deterministic manner, eg via the use of the D modifier, then
           replacement will always happen and the u modifier will be ineffective.

       U   Do not operate in deterministic mode.  This is the inverse of the  D  modifier,  above:  added  files  and  the
           archive index will get their actual UID, GID, timestamp, and file mode values.

           This is the default unless binutils was configured with --enable-deterministic-archives.

       v   This  modifier  requests  the verbose version of an operation.  Many operations display additional information,
           such as filenames processed, when the modifier v is appended.

       V   This modifier shows the version number of ar.

       The ar program also supports some command-line options which are neither modifiers nor actions, but which do change
       its behaviour in specific ways:

       --help
           Displays the list of command-line options supported by ar and then exits.

       --version
           Displays the version information of ar and then exits.

       -X32_64
           ar ignores an initial option spelled -X32_64, for compatibility with  AIX.   The  behaviour  produced  by  this
           option  is the default for GNU ar.  ar does not support any of the other -X options; in particular, it does not
           support -X32 which is the default for AIX ar.

       --plugin name
           The optional command-line switch --plugin name causes ar to load the plugin called name which adds support  for
           more file formats, including object files with link-time optimization information.

           This option is only available if the toolchain has been built with plugin support enabled.

           If  --plugin  is  not  provided,  but  plugin  support  has  been  enabled  then  ar iterates over the files in
           ${libdir}/bfd-plugins in alphabetic order and the first plugin that claims the object in question is used.

           Please note that this plugin search directory is not the one used by ld's -plugin option.  In order to make  ar
           use  the  linker plugin it must be copied into the ${libdir}/bfd-plugins directory.  For GCC based compilations
           the linker plugin is called liblto_plugin.so.0.0.0.  For Clang based compilations  it  is  called  LLVMgold.so.
           The  GCC  plugin  is  always  backwards  compatible with earlier versions, so it is sufficient to just copy the
           newest one.

       --target target
           The optional command-line switch --target bfdname specifies that the archive members  are  in  an  object  code
           format different from your system's default format.  See

       --output dirname
           The  --output  option  can  be  used  to  specify  a  path  to a directory into which archive members should be
           extracted.  If this option is not specified then the current directory will be used.

           Note - although the presence of this option does imply a x extraction  operation  that  option  must  still  be
           included on the command line.

       --record-libdeps libdeps
           The --record-libdeps option is identical to the l modifier, just handled in long form.

       --thin
           Make the specified archive a thin archive.  If it already exists and is a regular archive, the existing members
           must be present in the same directory as archive.

       @file
           Read  command-line options from file.  The options read are inserted in place of the original @file option.  If
           file does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated literally, and not removed.

           Options in file are separated by  whitespace.   A  whitespace  character  may  be  included  in  an  option  by
           surrounding  the entire option in either single or double quotes.  Any character (including a backslash) may be
           included by prefixing the character to be included with a backslash.  The file may  itself  contain  additional
           @file options; any such options will be processed recursively.

NAME
       add-apt-repository  - Adds a repository into the /etc/apt/sources.list or /etc/apt/sources.list.d or removes an ex‐
       isting one

SYNOPSIS
       add-apt-repository [OPTIONS] [LINE]

DESCRIPTION
       add-apt-repository is a script which adds an external APT repository to either /etc/apt/sources.list or a  file  in
       /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ or removes an already existing repository.

OPTIONS
       Note  that  the  --list, --ppa, --cloud, --uri, --sourceslist, and LINE parameters are mutually exclusive; only one
       (or none) of them may be specified.

       -h, --help
              Show help message and exit.

       -d, --debug
              Print debug information to the command line.

       -r, --remove
              Remove the specified repository.

              This first  will  disable  (comment  out)  the  matching  line(s),  and  then  any  modified  file(s)  under
              sources.list.d/ will be removed if they contain only empty and commented lines.

              Note that this performs differently when used with the --enable-source and/or --component parameters.  With‐
              out  either  of  those parameters, this removes the specified repository, including any deb-src line(s), and
              all components.  If --enable-source is used, this disables only the 'deb-src' line(s).   If  --component  is
              used, this removes only the specified component(s), and only removes the repository if no components remain.

              If  both  --enable-source  and --component are used with --remove, the actions are performed separately: the
              specified component(s) will be removed from both deb and deb-src lines, and deb-src lines will be disabled.

       -y, --yes
              Assume yes to all queries.

       -n, --no-update
              After adding the repository, do not update the package cache.

       -l, --login
              Login to Launchpad (this is only needed for private PPAs).

              Existing authentication token will be used or a request to interactively authorize a new one will  be  made.
              It  will  be saved in the desktop keyring (when available). To instead store authentication token in a file,
              specify one via environment variable LP_CREDENTIALS_FILE.

       -s, --enable-source
              Allow downloading of the source packages from the repository.

              This adds and enables a 'deb-src' line for the repository.

              If this parameter is used without any repository, it will enable  all  currently  existing  disabled  source
              repository (deb-src) entries that have a corresponding enabled binary repository (deb) entry.

              If  this  parameter is used twice without any repository, it will also add missing source repository entries
              for all existing binary repository (deb) entries.

       -c, --component
              Which component(s) should be used with the specified repository.

              If not specified, this will default to main.  This may be used multiple times  to  specify  multiple  compo‐
              nents.

              If  this  is  used  without any repository, it will add the component(s) to all currently existing (enabled)
              repositories, but only if listed in the main sources.list file.

       -p, --pocket
              What pocket to use.

              Defaults to none, which is equivalent to the release pocket.

              If this is used without any repository, it will add the pocket to all currently existing  repositories,  but
              only  if  listed in the main sources.list file. It will use the components currently configured with the re‐
              lease pocket, or if that is not currently configured, it will use the main and restricted components.

       --dry-run
              Show what would be done, but don't make any changes.

       -L, --list
              List currently configured repositories.

              This will only list enabled repositories; it will not show disabled repository lines.

              By default, this shows only binary (deb) repositories.  If --enable-source is also used, this will also show
              source (deb-src) repositories.

       -P, --ppa
              Add an Ubuntu Launchpad Personal Package Archive.

              Must be in the format ppa:USER/PPA, USER/PPA, or USER.

              The USER parameter should be the Launchpad team or person that owns the PPA.  The PPA  parameter  should  be
              the name of the PPA; if not provided, it defaults to 'ppa'.

              The GPG public key of the PPA will also be downloaded and added to apt's keyring.

              To  add a private PPA, you must also use the --login parameter, and of course you must also be subscribed to
              the private PPA.

       -C, --cloud
              Add an Ubuntu Cloud Archive.

              Must be in the format cloud-archive:CANAME, uca:CANAME, or CANAME.

              The CANAME parameter should be the name of the Cloud Archive.  The CANAME parameter may optionally  be  suf‐
              fixed with the pocket, as either -updates or -proposed.  If not specified, the pocket defaults to -updates.

       -U, --uri
              Add an archive, specified as a single URI.

              If the URI provided is detected to be a PPA, this will operate as if the --ppa parameter was used.

       -S, --sourceslist
              Add an archive, specified as a full source entry line in one-line sources.list format.

              This must follow the ONE-LINE-STYLE format as described in the sources.list manpage.

              If the URI provided is detected to be a PPA, this will operate as if the --ppa parameter was used.

LINE
       LINE is a deprecated method to specify the repository to add/remove, provided only for backwards compatibility.  It
       can  be  specified  in  any  of the supported formats: sources.list line, plain uri, ppa shortcut, or cloud-archive
       shortcut.  It can also be specified as one or more valid component(s).  The script will  attempt  to  detect  which
       format is provided.

       This  is  not recommended as the autodetection of which line format is intended can be ambiguous, but older scripts
       may still use this method of specifying the repository.

       One special case of LINE is providing the value -, which will then read the LINE from stdin.

ALSAMIXER(1)                                      General Commands Manual                                     ALSAMIXER(1)

NAME
       alsamixer - soundcard mixer for ALSA soundcard driver, with ncurses interface

SYNOPSIS
       alsamixer [options]

DESCRIPTION
       alsamixer is an ncurses mixer program for use with the ALSA soundcard drivers. It supports multiple soundcards with
       multiple devices.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Help: show available flags.

       -c, --card <card number or identification>
              Select the soundcard to use, if you have more than one. Cards are numbered from 0 (the default).

       -D, --device <device identification>
              Select the mixer device to control.

       -V, --view <mode>
              Select the starting view mode, either playback, capture or all.

       -B, --black-background
              Use the black background color.

       -g, --no-color
              Toggle the using of colors.

MIXER VIEWS
       The top-left corner of alsamixer shows some basic information: the card name, the mixer chip name, the current view
       mode and the currently selected mixer item.  When the mixer item is switched off, [Off] is displayed in its name.

       Volume bars are located below the basic information area.  You can scroll left/right when all controls can't be put
       in a single screen.  The name of each control is shown in the bottom below the volume bars.  The currently selected
       item is drawn in red and/or emphasized.

       Each  mixer  control with volume capability shows a box and the current volume filled in that box.  The volume per‐
       centages are displayed below the volume bar for left and right channels.  For a mono control,  only  one  value  is
       shown there.

       When a mixer control is turned off, M (mute) appears below the volume bar.  When it's turned on, O in green appears
       instead.  You can toggle the switch via m key.

       When  a mixer control has capture capability, the capture flag appears below the volume bar, too.  When the capture
       is turned off, ------- is shown.  CAPTURE in red appears when the capture switch is turned on.  In addition, L  and
       R letters appear in left and right side to indicate that left and the right channels are turned on.

       Some  controls  have  the enumeration list, and don't show boxes but only texts which indicate the currently active
       item.  You can change the item via up/down keys.

VIEW MODES
       alsamixer has three view modes: playback, capture and all.  In the playback view, only the  controls  related  with
       playback  are  shown.  Similarly, only the controls for capture (recording) are shown in the capture view.  The all
       view mode shows all controls.  The current view mode is displayed in the top-left position together with the  mixer
       name, etc.

       The default view mode is the playback view.  You can change it via -V option.

       Each view mode can be switched via keyboard commands, too.  See the next section.

KEYBOARD COMMANDS
       alsamixer  recognizes  the following keyboard commands to control the soundcard.  Commands shown here in upper case
       can also be given in lower case.  To be reminded of these keystrokes, hit the h key.

   General Controls
       The Left and right arrow keys are used to select the channel (or device, depending on your preferred  terminology).
       You can also use n ("next") and p ("previous").

       The  Up  and Down Arrows control the volume for the currently selected device. You can also use + or - for the same
       purpose. Both the left and right signals are affected. For independent left and right control, see below.

       The B or = key adjusts the balance of volumes on left and right channels.

       M toggles muting for the current channel (both left and right).  If the hardware supports it, you can mute left and
       right independently by using , (or <) and . (or >) respectively.

       SPACE enables recording for the current channel. If any other channels have recording enabled, they will have their
       recording function disabled first. This only works for valid input channels, of course.

       L re-draws the screen.

   View Mode Controls
       Function keys are used to change view modes.  You can switch to the help mode and the proc info mode via F1 and  F2
       keys, respectively.  On terminals that can't use function keys like gnome-terminal, ? and / keys can be used alter‐
       natively for help and proc modes.

       F3,  F4  and  F5 keys are used to switch to playback, capture and all view mode, respectively.  TAB key toggles the
       current view mode circularly.

   Quick Volume Changes
       PageUp increases volume by 5.

       PageDown decreases volume by 5.

       End sets volume to 0.

       You can also control left & right levels for the current channel independently, as follows:

       [Q | W | E ]  -- turn UP [ left | both | right ]

       [Z | X | C ] -- turn DOWN [ left | both | right ]

       If the currently selected mixer channel is not a stereo channel, then all UP keys will work like W,  and  all  DOWN
       keys will work like X.

       The number keys from 0 to 9 are to change the absolute volume quickly.  They correspond to 0 to 90% volume.

   Selecting the Sound Card
       You  can select another sound card by pressing the F6 or S keys.  This will show a list of available sound cards to
       choose from, and an entry to enter the mixer device name by hand.

   Exiting
       Quit the program with ALT Q, or by hitting ESC.  Please note that you might need to hit ESC twice on some terminals
       since it's regarded as a prefix key.

VOLUME MAPPING
       In alsamixer, the volume is mapped to a value that is more natural for a human ear.  The  mapping  is  designed  so
       that the position in the interval is proportional to the volume as a human ear would perceive it, i.e. the position
       is the cubic root of the linear sample multiplication factor.  For controls with a small range (24 dB or less), the
       mapping is linear in the dB values so that each step has the same size visually.

       Only  for controls without dB information, a linear mapping of the hardware volume register values is used (this is
       the same algorithm as used in the old alsamixer).

FILES
       Configuration is read from the following files:

       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/alsamixer.rc

       $HOME/.config/alsamixer.rc

APPRES(1)                                         General Commands Manual                                        APPRES(1)

NAME
       appres - list X application resource database

SYNOPSIS
       appres [class [instance]] [-1] [-V] [toolkitoptions]

DESCRIPTION
       The  appres program prints the resources seen by an application (or subhierarchy of an application) with the speci‐
       fied class and instance names.  It can be used to determine which resources a particular program  will  load.   For
       example,

            % appres  XTerm

       will  list  the  resources  that any xterm program will load.  If no application class is specified, the class -Ap‐
       pResTest- is used.

       To match a particular instance name, specify an instance name explicitly after the class name, or use the normal Xt
       toolkit option.  For example,

            % appres  XTerm  myxterm
       or
            % appres  XTerm  -name  myxterm

       To list resources that match a subhierarchy of an application, specify hierarchical class and instance names.   The
       number of class and instance components must be equal, and the instance name should not be specified with a toolkit
       option.  For example,

            % appres  Xman.TopLevelShell.Form  xman.topBox.form

       will  list the resources of widgets of xman topBox hierarchy.  To list just the resources matching a specific level
       in the hierarchy, use the -1 option.  For example,

            % appres  XTerm.VT100  xterm.vt100  -1

       will list the resources matching the xterm vt100 widget.

       The -V option prints the appres command version and exits.

NAME
       bitmap, bmtoa, atobm - bitmap editor and converter utilities for the X Window System

SYNOPSIS
       bitmap [ -options ... ] [ filename ] [ basename ]

       bmtoa [ -chars ... ] [ filename ]

       atobm [ -chars cc ] [ -name variable ] [ -xhot number ] [ -yhot number ] [ filename ]

DESCRIPTION
       The  bitmap  program  is  a  rudimentary  tool  for  creating or editing rectangular images made up of 1's and 0's.
       Bitmaps are used in X for defining clipping regions, cursor shapes, icon shapes, and tile and stipple patterns.

       The bmtoa and atobm filters convert bitmap files (FILE FORMAT) to and from ASCII strings.  They are  most  commonly
       used to quickly print out bitmaps and to generate versions for including in text.

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
       Bitmap  supports  the standard X Toolkit command line arguments (see X(7)).  The following additional arguments are
       supported as well.

       -size WIDTHxHEIGHT
           Specifies size of the grid in squares.

       -sw dimension
           Specifies the width of squares in pixels.

       -sh dimension
           Specifies the height of squares in pixels.

       -gt dimension
           Grid tolerance.  If the square dimensions fall below the specified value, grid  will  be  automatically  turned
           off.

       -grid, +grid
           Turns on or off the grid lines.

       -axes, +axes
           Turns on or off the major axes.

       -dashed, +dashed
           Turns on or off dashing for the frame and grid lines.

       -stippled, +stippled
           Turns on or off stippling of highlighted squares.

       -proportional, +proportional
           Turns  proportional  mode  on  or off.  If proportional mode is on, square width is equal to square height.  If
           proportional mode is off, bitmap will use the smaller square dimension, if they were initially different.

       -dashes filename
           Specifies the bitmap to be used as a stipple for dashing.

       -stipple filename
           Specifies the bitmap to be used as a stipple for highlighting.

       -hl color
           Specifies the color used for highlighting.

       -fr color
           Specifies the color used for the frame and grid lines.

       filename
           Specifies the bitmap to be initially loaded into the program.  If the file does not exist, bitmap  will  assume
           it is a new file.

       basename
           Specifies the basename to be used in the C code output file.  If it is different than the basename in the work‐
           ing file, bitmap will change it when saving the file.

       Bmtoa accepts the following option:

       -chars cc
           This  option  specifies the pair of characters to use in the string version of the bitmap.  The first character
           is used for 0 bits and the second character is used for 1 bits.  The default is to use dashes (-) for  0's  and
           sharp signs (#) for 1's.

       Atobm accepts the following options:

       -chars cc
           This option specifies the pair of characters to use when converting string bitmaps into arrays of numbers.  The
           first  character  represents a 0 bit and the second character represents a 1 bit.  The default is to use dashes
           (-) for 0's and sharp signs (#) for 1's.

       -name variable
           This option specifies the variable name to be used when writing out the bitmap file.  The default is to use the
           basename of the filename command line argument or leave it blank if the standard input is read.

       -xhot number
           This option specifies the X coordinate of the hotspot.  Only positive  values  are  allowed.   By  default,  no
           hotspot information is included.

       -yhot number
           This  option  specifies  the  Y  coordinate  of the hotspot.  Only positive values are allowed.  By default, no
           hotspot information is included.

USAGE
       Bitmap displays grid in which each square represents a single bit in the picture being edited.  Actual size of  the
       bitmap  image,  as  it would appear normally and inverted, can be obtained by pressing Meta-I key.  You are free to
       move the image popup out of the way to continue editing.  Pressing the left mouse button in  the  popup  window  or
       Meta-I again will remove the real size bitmap image.

       If  the  bitmap  is to be used for defining a cursor, one of the squares in the images may be designated as the hot
       spot.  This determines where the cursor is actually pointing.  For cursors with sharp tips (such as arrows or  fin‐
       gers), this is usually at the end of the tip; for symmetric cursors (such as crosses or bullseyes), this is usually
       at the center.

       Bitmaps are stored as small C code fragments suitable for including in applications.  They provide an array of bits
       as  well  as  symbolic constants giving the width, height, and hot spot (if specified) that may be used in creating
       cursors, icons, and tiles.

EDITING
       To edit a bitmap image simply click on one of the buttons with drawing commands  (Point,  Curve,  Line,  Rectangle,
       etc.) and move the pointer into the bitmap grid window.  Press one of the buttons on your mouse and the appropriate
       action  will  take place.  You can either set, clear or invert the grid squares.  Setting a grid square corresponds
       to setting a bit in the bitmap image to 1.  Clearing a grid square corresponds to setting a bit in the bitmap image
       to 0.  Inverting a grid square corresponds to changing a bit in the bitmap image from 0 to 1 or 1 to  0,  depending
       what its previous state was.  The default behavior of mouse buttons is as specified below.

                 MouseButton1        Set
                 MouseButton2        Invert
                 MouseButton3        Clear
                 MouseButton4        Clear
                 MouseButton5        Clear

       This default behavior can be changed by setting the button function resources.  An example is provided below.

                 bitmap*button1Function: Set
                 bitmap*button2Function: Clear
                 bitmap*button3Function: Invert
                 etc.

       The  button function applies to all drawing commands, including copying, moving and pasting, flood filling and set‐
       ting the hot spot.

DRAWING COMMANDS
       Here is the list of drawing commands accessible through the buttons at the left side of the  application's  window.
       Some  commands can be aborted by pressing A inside the bitmap window, allowing the user to select different guiding
       points where applicable.

       Clear
           This command clears all bits in the bitmap image.  The grid squares  will  be  set  to  the  background  color.
           Pressing C inside the bitmap window has the same effect.

       Set This  command sets all bits in the bitmap image.  The grid squares will be set to the foreground color.  Press‐
           ing S inside the bitmap window has the same effect.

       Invert
           This command inverts all bits in the bitmap image.  The grid squares will be inverted appropriately.   Pressing
           I inside the bitmap window has the same effect.

       Mark
           This command is used to mark an area of the grid by dragging out a rectangular shape in the highlighting color.
           Once  the  area  is  marked,  it can be operated on by a number of commands (see Up, Down, Left, Right, Rotate,
           Flip, Cut, etc.)  Only one marked area can be present at any time.  If you attempt to mark  another  area,  the
           old  mark  will vanish.  The same effect can be achieved by pressing Shift-MouseButton1 and dragging out a rec‐
           tangle in the grid window.  Pressing Shift-MouseButton2 will mark the entire grid area.

       Unmark
           This command will cause the marked area to vanish.  The same effect can be achieved by pressing Shift-MouseBut‐
           ton3.

       Copy
           This command is used to copy an area of the grid from one location to another.  If there is no marked grid area
           displayed, Copy behaves just like Mark described above.  Once there is a marked  grid  area  displayed  in  the
           highlighting  color, this command has two alternative behaviors.  If you click a mouse button inside the marked
           area, you will be able to drag the rectangle that represents the marked area to the  desired  location.   After
           you  release the mouse button, the area will be copied.  If you click outside the marked area, Copy will assume
           that you wish to mark a different region of the bitmap image, thus it will behave like Mark again.

       Move
           This command is used to move an area of the grid from one location to another.  Its behavior resembles the  be‐
           havior of Copy command, except that the marked area will be moved instead of copied.

       Flip Horizontally
           This  command  will flip the bitmap image with respect to the horizontal axes.  If a marked area of the grid is
           highlighted, it will operate only inside the marked area.  Pressing H inside the bitmap window has the same ef‐
           fect.

       Up  This command moves the bitmap image one pixel up.  If a marked area of the grid is highlighted, it will operate
           only inside the marked area.  Pressing UpArrow inside the bitmap window has the same effect.

       Flip Vertically
           This command will flip the bitmap image with respect to the vertical axes.  If a marked area  of  the  grid  is
           highlighted, it will operate only inside the marked area.  Pressing V inside the bitmap window has the same ef‐
           fect.

       Left
           This  command  moves  the  bitmap image one pixel to the left.  If a marked area of the grid is highlighted, it
           will operate only inside the marked area.  Pressing LeftArrow inside the bitmap window has the same effect.

       Fold
           This command will fold the bitmap image so that the opposite corners become adjacent.  This is useful when cre‐
           ating bitmap images for tiling.  Pressing F inside the bitmap window has the same effect.

       Right
           This command moves the bitmap image one pixel to the right.  If a marked area of the grid  is  highlighted,  it
           will operate only inside the marked area.  Pressing RightArrow inside the bitmap window has the same effect.

       Rotate Left
           This command rotates the bitmap image 90 degrees to the left (counter clockwise.)  If a marked area of the grid
           is  highlighted, it will operate only inside the marked area.  Pressing L inside the bitmap window has the same
           effect.

       Down
           This command moves the bitmap image one pixel down.  If a marked area of the grid is highlighted, it will oper‐
           ate only inside the marked area.  Pressing DownArrow inside the bitmap window has the same effect.

       Rotate Right
           This command rotates the bitmap image 90 degrees to the right (clockwise.)  If a marked area  of  the  grid  is
           highlighted, it will operate only inside the marked area.  Pressing R inside the bitmap window has the same ef‐
           fect.

       Point
           This command will change the grid squares underneath the mouse pointer if a mouse button is being pressed down.
           If  you drag the mouse button continuously, the line may not be continuous, depending on the speed of your sys‐
           tem and frequency of mouse motion events.

       Curve
           This command will change the grid squares underneath the mouse pointer if a mouse button is being pressed down.
           If you drag the mouse button continuously, it will make sure that the line is continuous.  If  your  system  is
           slow or bitmap receives very few mouse motion events, it might behave quite strangely.

       Line
           This  command will change the grid squares in a line between two squares.  Once you press a mouse button in the
           grid window, bitmap will highlight the line from the square where the mouse button was initially pressed to the
           square where the mouse pointer is located.  By releasing the mouse button you will cause the change to take ef‐
           fect, and the highlighted line will disappear.

       Rectangle
           This command will change the grid squares in a rectangle between two squares.  Once you press a mouse button in
           the grid window, bitmap will highlight the rectangle from the square  where  the  mouse  button  was  initially
           pressed  to  the  square  where the mouse pointer is located.  By releasing the mouse button you will cause the
           change to take effect, and the highlighted rectangle will disappear.

       Filled Rectangle
           This command is identical to Rectangle, except at the end the rectangle will be filled rather than outlined.

       Circle
           This command will change the grid squares in a circle between two squares.  Once you press a  mouse  button  in
           the  grid window, bitmap will highlight the circle from the square where the mouse button was initially pressed
           to the square where the mouse pointer is located.  By releasing the mouse button you will cause the  change  to
           take effect, and the highlighted circle will disappear.

       Filled Circle
           This command is identical to Circle, except at the end the circle will be filled rather than outlined.

       Flood Fill
           This  command  will  flood  fill  the connected area underneath the mouse pointer when you click on the desired
           square.  Diagonally adjacent squares are not considered to be connected.

       Set Hot Spot
           This command designates one square in the grid as the hot spot if this bitmap image is to be used for  defining
           a cursor.  Pressing a mouse button in the desired square will cause a diamond shape to be displayed.

       Clear Hot Spot
           This command removes any designated hot spot from the bitmap image.

       Undo
           This  command  will  undo  the last executed command.  It has depth one, that is, pressing Undo after Undo will
           undo itself.

FILE MENU
       The File menu commands can be accessed by pressing the File button and selecting the appropriate menu entry, or  by
       pressing  Ctrl  key  with  another key.  These commands deal with files and global bitmap parameters, such as size,
       basename, filename etc.

       New This command will clear the editing area and prompt for the name of the new file to be  edited.   It  will  not
           load in the new file.

       Load
           This  command  is  used  to  load  a new bitmap file into the bitmap editor.  If the current image has not been
           saved, user will be asked whether to save or ignore the changes.  The editor can edit only one file at a  time.
           If you need interactive editing, run a number of editors and use cut and paste mechanism as described below.

       Insert
           This  command  is used to insert a bitmap file into the image being currently edited.  After being prompted for
           the filename, click inside the grid window and drag the outlined rectangle to the location where  you  want  to
           insert the new file.

       Save
           This  command  will save the bitmap image.  It will not prompt for the filename unless it is said to be <none>.
           If you leave the filename undesignated or -, the output will be piped to stdout.

       Save As
           This command will save the bitmap image after prompting for a new filename.  It should be used if you  want  to
           change the filename.

       Resize
           This command is used to resize the editing area to the new number of pixels.  The size should be entered in the
           WIDTHxHEIGHT format.  The information in the image being edited will not be lost unless the new size is smaller
           that the current image size.  The editor was not designed to edit huge files.

       Rescale
           This  command  is  used to rescale the editing area to the new width and height.  The size should be entered in
           the WIDTHxHEIGHT format.  It will not do antialiasing and information will  be  lost  if  you  rescale  to  the
           smaller sizes.  Feel free to add you own algorithms for better rescaling.

       Filename
           This  command is used to change the filename without changing the basename nor saving the file.  If you specify
           - for a filename, the output will be piped to stdout.

       Basename
           This command is used to change the basename, if a different one from the specified filename is desired.

       Quit
           This command will terminate the bitmap application.  If the file was not saved, user will be prompted and asked
           whether to save the image or not.  This command is preferred over killing the process.

EDIT MENU
       The Edit menu commands can be accessed by pressing the Edit button and selecting the appropriate menu entry, or  by
       pressing  Meta  key with another key.  These commands deal with editing facilities such as grid, axes, zooming, cut
       and paste, etc.

       Image
           This command will display the image being edited and its inverse in its actual size in a separate window.   The
           window  can  be  moved  away to continue with editing.  Pressing the left mouse button in the image window will
           cause it to disappear from the screen.

       Grid
           This command controls the grid in the editing area.  If the grid spacing is below the value specified by  grid‐
           Tolerance resource (8 by default), the grid will be automatically turned off.  It can be enforced by explicitly
           activating this command.

       Dashed
           This  command controls the stipple for drawing the grid lines.  The stipple specified by dashes resource can be
           turned on or off by activating this command.

       Axes
           This command controls the highlighting of the main axes of the image being edited.  The actual  lines  are  not
           part  of the image.  They are provided to aid user when constructing symmetrical images, or whenever having the
           main axes highlighted helps your editing.

       Stippled
           This command controls the stippling of the highlighted areas of the bitmap image.   The  stipple  specified  by
           stipple resource can be turned on or off by activating this command.

       Proportional
           This  command  controls  the  proportional mode.  If the proportional mode is on, width and height of all image
           squares are forced to be equal, regardless of the proportions of the bitmap window.

       Zoom
           This command controls the zoom mode.  If there is a marked area of the image already displayed, bitmap will au‐
           tomatically zoom into it.  Otherwise, user will have to highlight an area to be edited in  the  zoom  mode  and
           bitmap will automatically switch into it.  One can use all the editing commands and other utilities in the zoom
           mode.  When you zoom out, undo command will undo the whole zoom session.

       Cut This commands cuts the contents of the highlighted image area into the internal cut and paste buffer.

       Copy
           This command copies the contents of the highlighted image area into the internal cut and paste buffer.

       Paste
           This  command  will check if there are any other bitmap applications with a highlighted image area, or if there
           is something in the internal cut and paste buffer and copy it to the image.  To place the copied  image,  click
           in  the  editing window and drag the outlined image to the position where you want to place i, and then release
           the button.

CUT AND PASTE
       Bitmap supports two cut and paste mechanisms; the internal cut and paste and the global X selection cut and  paste.
       The  internal  cut  and  paste is used when executing copy and move drawing commands and also cut and copy commands
       from the edit menu.  The global X selection cut and paste is used whenever there is a highlighted area of a  bitmap
       image  displayed  anywhere  on the screen.  To copy a part of image from another bitmap editor simply highlight the
       desired area by using the Mark command or pressing the shift key and dragging the area with the left mouse  button.
       When the selected area becomes highlighted, any other applications (such as xterm, etc.) that use primary selection
       will  discard  their  selection values and unhighlight the appropriate information.  Now, use the Paste command for
       the Edit menu or control mouse button to copy the selected part of image into another (or the same) bitmap applica‐
       tion.  If you attempt to do this without a visible highlighted image area, the bitmap will fall back to the  inter‐
       nal cut and paste buffer and paste whatever was there stored at the moment.

WIDGETS
       Below is the widget structure of the bitmap application.  Indentation indicates hierarchical structure.  The widget
       class name is given first, followed by the widget instance name.  All widgets except the bitmap widget are from the
       standard Athena widget set.

                                Command undo

COLORS
       If you would like bitmap to be viewable in color, include the following in the #ifdef COLOR section of the file you
       read with xrdb:

       *customization:                 -color

       This will cause bitmap to pick up the colors in the app-defaults color customization file:

           /etc/X11/app-defaults/Bitmap-color

BITMAP WIDGET
       Bitmap widget is a stand-alone widget for editing raster images.  It is not designed to edit large images, although
       it  may be used in that purpose as well.  It can be freely incorporated with other applications and used as a stan‐
       dard editing tool.  The following are the resources provided by the bitmap widget.

NAME
       addgnupghome - Create .gnupg home directories

SYNOPSIS
       addgnupghome account_1 account_2...account_n

DESCRIPTION
       If  GnuPG is installed on a system with existing user accounts, it is sometimes required to populate the GnuPG home
       directory with existing files.  Especially a ‘trustlist.txt’ and a keybox with some initial certificates are  often
       desired.   This script helps to do this by copying all files from ‘/etc/skel/.gnupg’ to the home directories of the
       accounts given on the command line.  It takes care not to overwrite existing GnuPG home directories.

       addgnupghome is invoked by root as:

         addgnupghome account1 account2 ... accountn

NAME
       alsatplg - ALSA Topology Compiler

SYNOPSIS
       alsatplg <options> [command]

DESCRIPTION
       alsatplg  (ALSA  Topology  compiler) is a program to compile topology configuration file to the binary file for the
       kernel drivers.

       Current audio drivers typically hard code topology information in the driver sources: This tightly couples the  au‐
       dio driver to the development board making it time consuming to modify a driver to work on a different devices. The
       driver  is  also  tightly  coupled  to the DSP firmware version meaning extra care is needed to keep the driver and
       firmware version in sync.  New firmware features also mean driver updates.

       The ALSA topology project removes the need for re-writing or porting audio drivers to different devices or  differ‐
       ent firmwares: Drivers have no hard coded topology data meaning a single driver can be used on different devices by
       updating  the  topology data from the file system. Firmware updates can be pushed without having to update the dri‐
       vers. The new firmware just needs to include an updated topology file describing the update.

OPTIONS
       Available options:

NAME
       appstreamcli - Handle AppStream metadata formats and query AppStream data

SYNOPSIS

       appstreamcli [COMMAND]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the appstreamcli command.

       appstreamcli is a small helper tool to work with AppStream metadata and access the AppStream component index from
       the command-line. The AppStream component index contains a list of all available software components for your
       distribution, matched to their package names. It is generated using AppStream XML or Debian DEP-11 data, which is
       provided by your distributor.

       For more information about the AppStream project and the other components which are part of it, take a look at the
       AppStream pages at Freedesktop.org[1].

OPTIONS
       get ID
           Get a component from the metadata pool by its identifier.

       s, search TERM
           Search the AppStream component pool for a given search term.

       what-provides TYPE TERM
           Return components which provide a given item. An item type can be specified using the TYPE parameter, a value
           to search for has to be supplied using the TERM parameter.

           Examples:

           Get components which handle the "text/xml" mediatype.

           appstreamcli what-provides mediatype "text/xml"

           Get component which provides the "libfoo.so.2" library.

           appstreamcli what-provides lib libfoo.so.2

       refresh, refresh-cache
           Trigger a database refresh, if necessary. In case you want to force the database to be rebuilt, supply the
           --force flag.

           This command must be executed with root permission.

       status
           Display various information about the installed metadata and the metadata cache.

       os-info
           Show information about the current operating system from the metadata index. This requires the operating system
           to provide a operating-system component for itself.

       dump ID
           Dump the complete XML descriptions of components with the given ID that were found in the metadata pool.

       validate FILES
           Validate AppStream XML metadata for compliance with the specification.

           Both XML metadata types, upstream and distro XML, are handled. The format type which should be validated is
           determined automatically.

           The --pedantic flag triggers a more pedantic validation of the file, including minor and style issues in the
           report.

       validate-tree DIRECTORY
           Validate AppStream XML metadata found in a file-tree.

           This performs a standard validation of all found metadata, but also checks for additional errors, like the
           presence of .desktop files and validity of other additional metadata.

       check-license LICENSE
           Test a license string or license expression for validity and display details about it.

           This will check whether the license string is considered to be valid for AppStream, and return a non-zero exit
           code if it is not. The command will also display useful information like the canonical ID of a license, whether
           it is suitable as license for AppStream metadata, and whether the license is considered to be for Free and Open
           Source software or proprietary software.

           AppStream will consider any license as Free and Open Source that is marked as suitable by either the Free
           Software Foundation (FSF), Open Source Initiative (OSI) or explicit license list of the Debian Free Software
           Guidelines (DFSG).

       install ID
           Install a software component by its ID using the package manager or Flatpak.

           This resolves the AppStream component ID to an installation candidate and then calls either the native package
           manager or Flatpak (if available) to install the component.

       remove ID
           Uninstall a software component by its ID using the package manager or Flatpak.

           This will uninstall software matching the selected ID using either the native package manager or Flatpak (if
           available).

       put FILE
           Install a metadata file into the right directory on the current machine.

       compare-versions, vercmp VER1 [CMP] VER2
           Compare two version numbers. If two version numbers are given as parameters, the versions will be compared and
           the comparison result will be printed to stdout.

           If a version number, a comparison operator and another version number are passed in as parameter, the result of
           the comparison operation will be printed to stdout, and appstreamcli will exit with a non-zero exit status in
           case the comparison failed. The comparison operator can be one of the following:

           •   eq - Equal to

           •   ne - Not equal to

           •   lt - Less than

           •   gt - Greater than

           •   le - Less than or equal to

           •   ge - Greater than or equal to

       new-template TYPE FILE
           Create a metainfo file template to be used by software projects. The --from-desktop option can be used to use a
           .desktop file as template for generating the example file.

           The generated files contain example entries which need to be filed in with the actual desired values by the
           project author.

           The first TYPE parameter is the name of an AppStream component type. For a complete list check out the
           documentation[2] or the help output of appstreamcli for this subcommand.

       make-desktop-file MI_FILE DESKTOP_FILE
           Create a XDG desktop-entry file from a metainfo file. If the desktop-entry file specified in DESKTOP_FILE
           already exists, it will get extended with the new information extracted from the metainfo file. Otherwise a new
           file will be created.

           This command will use the first binary mentioned in a provides tag of the component for the Exec= field of the
           new desktop-entry file. If this is not the desired behavior, the --exec flag can be used to explicitly define a
           binary to launch. Other methods of launching the application are currently not supported.

           In order to generate a proper desktop-entry, this command assumes that not only the minimally required tags for
           an AppStream component are set, but also that it has an <icon/> tag of type "stock" to describe the stock icon
           that should be used as well as a <categories/> tag containing the categories the application should be placed
           in.

       news-to-metainfo NEWS_FILE MI_FILE [OUT_FILE]
           This command converts a NEWS file as used by many open source projects into the XML used by AppStream. Since
           NEWS files are free text, a lot of heuristics will be applied to get reasonable results. The converter can also
           read a YAML version of the AppStream release description and convert it to XML as well. If the metainfo file
           MI_FILE already exists, it will be augmented with the new release entries, otherwise the release entries will
           be written without any wrapping component. If [OUT_FILE] is specified, instead of acting on MI_FILE the changed
           data will be written to the particular file. If any of the output filenames is set to "-", the output will
           instead be written to stdout.

           The --format option can be used to enforce reading the input file in a specific format ("text" or "yaml") in
           case the format autodetection fails. The --limit option is used to limit the amount of release entries written
           (the newest entries will always be first).

       metainfo-to-news MI_FILE NEWS_FILE
           This command reverses the news-to-metainfo command and writes a NEWS file as text or YAML using the XML
           contained in a metainfo file. If NEWS_FILE is set to "-", the resulting data will be written to stdout instead
           of to a file.

           The --format option can be used to explicitly specify the output format ("yaml" or "text"). If it is not set,
           appstreamcli will guess which format is most suitable.

       convert FILE1 FILE1
           Converts AppStream XML metadata into its YAML representation and vice versa.

       compose
           Composes an AppStream metadata catalog from a directory tree with metainfo files. This command is only
           available if the org.freedesktop.appstream.compose component is installed. See appstreamcli-compose(1) for more
           information.

       --details
           Print out more information about a found component.

       --no-color
           Don't print colored output.

       --no-net
           Do not access the network when validating metadata.

           The same effect can be achieved by setting the AS_VALIDATE_NONET environment variable before running
           appstreamcli.

       --version
           Display the version number of appstreamcli

NAME
       arecord, aplay - command-line sound recorder and player for ALSA soundcard driver

SYNOPSIS
       arecord [flags] [filename]
       aplay [flags] [filename [filename]] ...

DESCRIPTION
       arecord  is  a  command-line soundfile recorder for the ALSA soundcard driver. It supports several file formats and
       multiple soundcards with multiple devices. If recording with interleaved mode samples  the  file  is  automatically
       split before the 2GB filesize.

       aplay is much the same, only it plays instead of recording. For supported soundfile formats, the sampling rate, bit
       depth, and so forth can be automatically determined from the soundfile header.

       If filename is not specified, the standard output or input is used. The aplay utility accepts multiple filenames.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Help: show syntax.

       --version
              Print current version.

       -t, --file-type TYPE
              File type (voc, wav, raw or au).  If this parameter is omitted the WAVE format is used.

       -c, --channels=#
              The number of channels.  The default is one channel.  Valid values are 1 through 32.

       -f --format=FORMAT
              Sample format
              Recognized  sample  formats are: S8 U8 S16_LE S16_BE U16_LE U16_BE S24_LE S24_BE U24_LE U24_BE S32_LE S32_BE
              U32_LE U32_BE FLOAT_LE FLOAT_BE FLOAT64_LE FLOAT64_BE  IEC958_SUBFRAME_LE  IEC958_SUBFRAME_BE  MU_LAW  A_LAW
              IMA_ADPCM  MPEG  GSM SPECIAL S24_3LE S24_3BE U24_3LE U24_3BE S20_3LE S20_3BE U20_3LE U20_3BE S18_3LE S18_3BE
              U18_3LE
              Some of these may not be available on selected hardware
              The available format shortcuts are:
              -f cd (16 bit little endian, 44100, stereo) [-f S16_LE -c2 -r44100]
              -f cdr (16 bit big endian, 44100, stereo) [-f S16_BE -c2 -r44100]
              -f dat (16 bit little endian, 48000, stereo) [-f S16_LE -c2 -r48000]
              If no format is given U8 is used.

       -r, --rate=#<Hz>
              Sampling rate in Hertz. The default rate is 8000 Hertz.  If the value specified is  less  than  300,  it  is
              taken as the rate in kilohertz.  Valid values are 2000 through 192000 Hertz.

       -d, --duration=#
              Interrupt after # seconds.  A value of zero means infinity.  The default is zero, so if this option is omit‐
              ted  then  the record/playback process will run until it is killed.  Either '-d' or '-s' option is available
              exclusively.

       -s, --samples=#
              Interrupt after transmission of # PCM frames.  A value of zero means infinity.  The default is zero,  so  if
              this  options  is omitted then the record/playback process will run until it is killed.  Either '-d' or '-s'
              option is available exclusively.

       -M, --mmap
              Use memory-mapped (mmap) I/O mode for the audio stream.  If this option is not set, the read/write I/O  mode
              will be used.

       -N, --nonblock
              Open  the  audio  device  in non-blocking mode. If the device is busy the program will exit immediately.  If
              this option is not set the program will block until the audio device is available again.

       -F, --period-time=#
              Distance between interrupts is # microseconds.  If no period time and no period size is given then a quarter
              of the buffer time is set.

       -B, --buffer-time=#
              Buffer duration is # microseconds If no buffer time and no buffer size is given  then  the  maximal  allowed
              buffer time but not more than 500ms is set.

       --period-size=#
              Distance  between interrupts is # frames If no period size and no period time is given then a quarter of the
              buffer size is set.

       --buffer-size=#
              Buffer duration is # frames If no buffer time and no buffer size is given then the  maximal  allowed  buffer
              time but not more than 500ms is set.

       -A, --avail-min=#
              Min available space for wakeup is # microseconds

       -R, --start-delay=#
              Delay for automatic PCM start is # microseconds (relative to buffer size if <= 0)

       -T, --stop-delay=#
              Delay for automatic PCM stop is # microseconds from xrun

       -v, --verbose
              Show  PCM  structure  and setup.  This option is accumulative.  The VU meter is displayed when this is given
              twice or three times.

       -V, --vumeter=TYPE
              Specifies the VU-meter type, either stereo or mono.  The stereo VU-meter is  available  only  for  2-channel
              stereo samples with interleaved format.

       -I, --separate-channels
              One  file  for each channel.  This option disables max-file-time and use-strftime, and ignores SIGUSR1.  The
              stereo VU meter is not available with separate channels.

       -P     Playback.  This is the default if the program is invoked by typing aplay.

       -C     Record.  This is the default if the program is invoked by typing arecord.

       -i, --interactive
              Allow interactive operation via stdin.  Currently only pause/resume via space or enter key is implemented.

       -m, --chmap=ch1,ch2,...
              Give the channel map to override or follow.  Pass channel position strings like FL, FR, etc.

              If a device supports the override of the channel map, aplay tries to pass the  given  channel  map.   If  it
              doesn't  support  the channel map override but still it provides the channel map information, aplay tries to
              rearrange the channel order in the buffer to match with the returned channel map from the device.

       --disable-resample
              Disable automatic rate resample.

       --disable-channels
              Disable automatic channel conversions.

       --disable-format
              Disable automatic format conversions.

       --disable-softvol
              Disable software volume control (softvol).

       --test-position
              Test ring buffer position.

       --test-coef=<coef>
              Test coefficient for ring buffer position; default is 8.  Expression for validation is: coef *  (buffer_size
              / 2).  Minimum value is 1.

       --test-nowait
              Do not wait for the ring buffer ‐ eats the whole CPU.

       --max-file-time
              While  recording,  when  the  output file has been accumulating sound for this long, close it and open a new
              output file.  Default is the maximum size supported by the file format: 2 GiB for WAV  files.   This  option
              has no effect if  --separate-channels is specified.

       --process-id-file <file name>
              aplay writes its process ID here, so other programs can send signals to it.

       --use-strftime
              When recording, interpret %-codes in the file name parameter using the strftime facility whenever the output
              file  is  opened.  The important strftime codes are: %Y is the year, %m month, %d day of the month, %H hour,
              %M minute and %S second.  In addition, %v is the file number, starting at 1.  When this option is specified,
              intermediate directories for the output file are created automatically.  This option has no effect if --sep‐
              arate-channels is specified.

       --dump-hw-params
              Dump hw_params of the device preconfigured status to stderr. The dump lists capabilities of the selected de‐
              vice such as supported formats, sampling rates, numbers of channels, period  and  buffer  bytes/sizes/times.
              For raw device hw:X this option basically lists hardware capabilities of the soundcard.

       --fatal-errors
              Disables recovery attempts when errors (e.g. xrun) are encountered; the aplay process instead aborts immedi‐
              ately.

SIGNALS
       When  recording,  SIGINT,  SIGTERM  and SIGABRT will close the output file and exit.  SIGUSR1 will close the output
       file, open a new one, and continue recording.  However, SIGUSR1 does not work with --separate-channels.

EXAMPLES
       aplay -c 1 -t raw -r 22050 -f mu_law foobar
              will play the raw file "foobar" as a 22050-Hz, mono, 8-bit, Mu-Law .au file.

       arecord -d 10 -f cd -t wav -D copy foobar.wav
              will record foobar.wav as a 10-second, CD-quality wave file, using the PCM "copy" (which might be defined in
              the user's .asoundrc file as:
              pcm.copy {
                type plug
                slave {
                  pcm hw
                }
                route_policy copy
              }

       arecord -t wav --max-file-time 30 mon.wav
              Record from the default audio source in monaural, 8,000 samples per second, 8 bits per sample.  Start a  new
              file every 30 seconds.  File names are mon-nn.wav, where nn increases from 01.  The file after mon-99.wav is
              mon-100.wav.

       arecord -f cd -t wav --max-file-time 3600 --use-strftime %Y/%m/%d/listen-%H-%M-%v.wav
              Record  in stereo from the default audio source.  Create a new file every hour.  The files are placed in di‐
              rectories based on their start dates and have names which include their start times and file numbers.

DESCRIPTION
       adduser  and addgroup add users and groups to the system according to command line options and configuration infor‐
       mation in /etc/adduser.conf.  They are friendlier front ends to the low level  tools  like  useradd,  groupadd  and
       usermod  programs,  by default choosing Debian policy conformant UID and GID values, creating a home directory with
       skeletal configuration, running a custom script, and other features.

       adduser and addgroup are intended as a policy layer, making it easier for package maintainers and local administra‐
       tors to create local system accounts in the way Debian expects them to be created, taking the burden  to  adapt  to
       the  probably changing specifications of Debian policy.  adduser --system takes special attention on just needing a
       single call in the package maintainer scripts without any conditional wrappers, error suppression  or  other  scaf‐
       folding.

       adduser honors the distinction between dynamically allocated system users and groups and dynamically allocated user
       accounts that is documented in Debian Policy, Chapter 9.2.2.

       For a full list and explanations of all options, see the OPTIONS section.

       adduser and addgroup can be run in one of five modes:

   Add a normal user
       If  called  with  one  non-option  argument and without the --system or --group  options, adduser will add a normal
       user, that means a dynamically allocated user account in the sense of Debian Policy.  This is commonly referred  to
       in adduser as a non-system user.

       adduser will choose the first available UID from the range specified by FIRST_UID and LAST_UID in the configuration
       file.   The  range  may be overridden with the --firstuid and --lastuid options.  Finally, the UID can be set fully
       manually with the --uid option.

       By default, each user is given a corresponding group with the same name.  This is commonly  called  Usergroups  and
       allows  group  writable directories to be easily maintained by placing the appropriate users in the new group, set‐
       ting the set-group-ID bit in the directory, and ensuring that all users use a umask of 002.

       For a usergroup, adduser will choose the first available GID from the range specified by FIRST_GID and LAST_GID  in
       the  configuration  file.  The range may be overridden with the --firstgid and --lastgid options.  Finally, the GID
       can be set fully manually with the --gid option.

       The interaction between USERS_GID, USERS_GROUP, and USERGROUPS is explained in detail in adduser.conf(5).

       Users' primary groups can also be overridden from the command line with the --gid  or --ingroup options to set  the
       group  by  id  or  name,  respectively.  Also, users can be added to one or more supplemental groups defined as EX‐
       TRA_GROUPS in the configuration file either by setting ADD_EXTRA_GROUPS to 1 in the configuration file, or by pass‐
       ing --add-extra-groups on the command line.

       adduser will copy files from /etc/skel into the home directory and prompt for the comment field and a  password  if
       those functions have not been turned off / overridden from the command line.

       UID, comment, home directory and shell might be pre-determined with the UID_POOL and GID_POOL option, documented in
       adduser.conf(5).

       To set up an encrypted home directory for the new user, add the --encrypt-home option.  For more information, refer
       to the -b option of ecryptfs-setup-private(1).

   Add a system user
       If  called  with  one  non-option argument and the --system option, adduser will add a dynamically allocated system
       user, often abbreviated as system user in the context of the adduser package.

       adduser will choose the first available UID from the range specified by FIRST_SYSTEM_UID and LAST_SYSTEM_UID in the
       configuration file.  This can be overridden with the --uid option.

       By default, system users are placed in the nogroup group.  To place the new system  user  in  an  already  existing
       group,  use  the  --gid or --ingroup options.  If the --group is given and the identically named group does not al‐
       ready exist, it is created with the same ID.

       If no home directory is specified, the default home directory for a new system user is /nonexistent.   This  direc‐
       tory should never exist on any Debian system, and adduser will never create it automatically.

       Unless  a  shell  is  explicitly  set  with  the  --shell  option,  the  new system user will have the shell set to
       /usr/sbin/nologin.  adduser --system does not set a password for the new account.  Skeletal configuration files are
       not copied.

       Other options will behave as for the creation of a normal user.  The files referenced by UID_POOL and  GID_POOL  do
       also work.

   Add a group
       If adduser is called with the --group option and without the --system option, or addgroup is called respectively, a
       user group will be added.

       A dynamically allocated system group, often abbreviated as system group in the context of the adduser package, will
       be created if adduser is called with the --system option.

       A  GID  will be chosen from the respective range specified for GIDs in the configuration file (FIRST_GID, LAST_GID,
       FIRST_SYSTEM_GID, LAST_SYSTEM_GID).  To override that mechanism, you can give the GID using the --gid option.

       For non-system groups, the range specified in the configuration file may be  overridden  with  the  --firstgid  and
       --lastgid options.

       The group is created with no members.

   Add an existing user to an existing group
       If called with two non-option arguments, adduser will add an existing user to an existing group.

OPTIONS
       Different  modes  of adduser allow different options.  If no valid modes are listed for a option, it is accepted in
       all modes.

       Short versions for certain options may exist for historical reasons.  They are going to stay supported, but are re‐
       moved from the documentation.  Users are advised to migrate to the long version of options.

       --add-extra-groups
              Add new user to extra groups defined in the configuration files' EXTRA_GROUPS  setting.   The  old  spelling
              --add_extra_groups  is  deprecated and will be supported in Debian bookworm only.  Valid Modes: adduser, ad‐
              duser --system.

       --allow-all-names
              Allow any user- and groupname which is supported by the underlying useradd(8),  including  names  containing
              non-ASCII  characters.   See  VALID  NAMES  in adduser.conf(5).  Valid Modes: adduser, adduser --system, ad‐
              dgroup, addgroup --system.

       --allow-bad-names
              Disable NAME_REGEX and SYS_NAME_REGEX check of names.  Only a weaker check for validity of the name  is  ap‐
              plied.   See  VALID  NAMES  in  adduser.conf(5).  Valid Modes: adduser, adduser --system, addgroup, addgroup
              --system.

       --comment comment
              Set the comment field for the new entry generated.  adduser will not ask for the information if this  option
              is  given.  This field is also known under the name GECOS field and contains information that is used by the
              finger(1) command.  This used to be the --gecos option, which is deprecated and will be removed after Debian
              bookworm.  Valid Modes: adduser, adduser --system.

       --conf file
              Use file instead of /etc/adduser.conf.  Multiple --conf options can be given.

       --debug
              Synonymous to --stdoutmsglevel=debug. Deprecated.

       --disabled-login
       --disabled-password
              Do not run passwd(1) to set a password.  In most situations, logins are still possible though  (for  example
              using SSH keys or through PAM) for reasons that are beyond adduser's scope.  --disabled-login will addition‐
              ally set the shell to /usr/sbin/nologin.  Valid Mode: adduser.

       --firstuid ID
       --lastuid ID
       --firstgid ID
       --lastgid ID
              Override  the  first  UID  /  last  UID  /  first  GID  /  last GID in the range that the uid is chosen from
              (FIRST_UID, LAST_UID,  FIRST_GID  and  LAST_GID,  FIRST_SYSTEM_UID,  LAST_SYSTEM_UID,  FIRST_SYSTEM_GID  and
              LAST_SYSTEM_GID  in the configuration file).  If a group is created as a usergroup, --firstgid and --lastgid
              are ignored.  The group gets the same ID as the user.  Valid Modes: adduser, adduser --system, for  --first‐
              gid and --lastgid also addgroup.

       --force-badname
       --allow-badname
              These are the deprecated forms of --allow-bad-names.  It will be removed during the release cycle of the De‐
              bian release after bookworm.

       --extrausers
              Uses extra users as the database.

       --gid ID
              When  creating a group, this option sets the group ID number of the new group to GID.  When creating a user,
              this option sets the primary group ID number of the new user to GID.  Valid Modes: adduser,  adduser  --sys‐
              tem, addgroup, addgroup --system.

       --group
              Using  this  option in adduser --system indicates that the new user should get an identically named group as
              its primary group.  If that identically named group is not already present, it is created.  If not  combined
              with  --system,  a group with the given name is created.  The latter is the default action if the program is
              invoked as addgroup.  Valid Modes: adduser --system, addgroup, addgroup --system.

       --help Display brief instructions.

       --home dir
              Use dir as the user's home directory, rather than the  default  specified  by  the  configuration  file  (or
              /nonexistent  if  adduser  --system is used).  If the directory does not exist, it is created.  Valid Modes:
              adduser, adduser --system.

       --ingroup GROUP
              When creating a user, this option sets the primary group ID number of the new user to the GID of  the  named
              group.   Unlike with the --gid option, the group is specified here by name rather than by numeric ID number.
              The group must already exist.  Valid Modes: adduser, adduser --system.

       --lastuid ID
       --lastgid ID
              Override the last UID / last GID.  See --firstuid.

       --no-create-home
              Do not create a home directory for the new user.  Note that the pathname for the new user's  home  directory
              will still be entered in the appropriate field in the /etc/passwd file.  The use of this option does not im‐
              ply  that this field should be empty.  Rather, it indicates to adduser that some other mechanism will be re‐
              sponsible for initializing the new user's home directory.  Valid Modes: adduser, adduser --system.

       --quiet
              Synonymous to --stdoutmsglevel=warn. Deprecated.

       --shell shell
              Use shell as the user's login shell, rather than  the  default  specified  by  the  configuration  file  (or
              /usr/sbin/nologin if adduser --system is used).  Valid Modes: adduser, adduser --system.

       --system
              Nomally, adduser creates dynamically allocated user accounts and groups as defined in Debian Policy, Chapter
              9.2.2.  With this option, adduser creates a dynamically allocated system user and group and changes its mode
              respectively.  Valid Modes: adduser, addgroup.

       --uid ID
              Force  the  new  userid  to  be  the given number.  adduser will fail if the userid is already taken.  Valid
              Modes: adduser, adduser --system.

       --verbose
              Synonymous to --stdoutmsglevel=info. Deprecated.

       --stdoutmsglevel prio
       --stderrmsglevel prio
       --logmsglevel prio
              Minimum priority for messages logged to syslog/journal and the console, respectively.  Values are trace, de‐
              bug, info, warn, err, and fatal.  Messages with the priority set here or higher get printed to  the  respec‐
              tive medium.  Messages printed to stderr are not repeated on stdout.  That allows the local admin to control
              adduser's  chattiness on the console and in the log independently, keeping probably confusing information to
              itself while still leaving helpful information in the log.

       -v , --version
              Display version and copyright information.

EXIT VALUES
       0      Success: The user or group exists as specified.  This can have 2 causes: The user or group  was  created  by
              this  call to adduser or the user or group was already present on the system as specified before adduser was
              invoked.  If adduser --system is invoked for a user already existing with the requested  or  compatible  at‐
              tributes, it will also return 0.

       11     The object that adduser was asked to create does already exist.

       12     The object that adduser or deluser was asked to operate on does not exist.

       13     The object that adduser or deluser was asked to operate on does ont have the properties that are required to
              complete  the operation: A user (a group) that was requested to be created as a system user (group) does al‐
              ready exist and is not a system user (group), or A user (group) that was requested to be created with a cer‐
              tain UID (GID) does already exist and has a different UID (GID), or A system user (group) that was requested
              to be deleted does exist, but is not a system user (group).

       21     The UID (GID) that was explicitly requested for a new user (group) is already in use.

       22     There is no available UID (GID) in the requested range.

       23     There is no group with the requested GID for the primary group for a new user.

       31     The chosen name for a new user or a new group does not conform to the selected naming rules.

       32     The home directory of a new user must be an absolute path.

       41     The group that was requested to be deleted is not empty.

       42     The user that was requested to be removed from a group is not a member in the first place.

       43     It is not possible to remove a user from its primary group, or no primary group selected for a new  user  by
              any method.

       51     Incorrect number or order of command line parameters detected.

       52     Incompatible options set in configuration file.

       53     Mutually incompatible command line options detected.

       54     adduser and deluser invoked as non-root and thus cannot work.

       55     deluser will refuse to delete the root account.

       56     A function was requested that needs more packages to be installed.  See Recommends: and Suggests: of the ad‐
              duser package.

       61     Adduser was aborted for some reason and tried to roll back the changes that were done during execution.

       Or for many other yet undocumented reasons which are printed to console then.  You  may  then  consider  to  remove
       --quiet to make adduser more verbose.

SECURITY
       adduser  needs root privileges and offers, via the --conf command line option to use different configuration files.
       Do not use sudo(8) or similar tools to give partial privileges to adduser with restricted command line  parameters.
       This  is easy to circumvent and might allow users to create arbitrary accounts.  If you want this, consider writing
       your own wrapper script and giving privileges to execute that script.

NOTES
       Unfortunately, the term system account suffers from double use in Debian.  It both means an account for the  actual
       Debian system, distinguishing itself from an application account which might exist in the user database of some ap‐
       plication running on Debian.  A system account in this definition has the potential to log in to the actual system,
       has  a UID, can be member in system groups, can own files and processes.  Debian Policy, au contraire, in its Chap‐
       ter 9.2.2, makes a distinguishment of dynamically allocated system users and groups and dynamically allocated  user
       accounts,  meaning in both cases special instances of system accounts.  Care must be taken to not confuse this ter‐
       minology.  Since adduser and deluser(8) never address application accounts and everything in this package  concerns
       system  accounts here, the usage of the terms user account and system account is actually not ambiguous in the con‐
       text of this package.  For clarity, this document uses the definition local system account or group if the distinc‐
       tion to application accounts or accounts managed in a directory service is needed.

       adduser used to have the vision to be the universal front end to the various directory services  for  creation  and
       deletion  of  regular  and system accounts in Debian since the 1990ies.  This vision has been abandoned as of 2022.
       The rationale behind this includes: that in practice, a small server system is not going to have write access to an
       enterprise-wide directory service anyway, that locally installed packages are hard to manage  with  centrally  con‐
       trolled system accounts, that enterprise directory services have their own management processes anyway and that the
       personpower of the adduser team is unlikely to be ever strong enough to write and maintain support for the plethora
       of directory services that need support.

       adduser  will constrict itself to being a policy layer for the management of local system accounts, using the tools
       from the password package for the actual work.

BUGS
       Inconsistent use of terminology around the term system account in docs and code is a bug.  Please report  this  and
       allow us to improve our docs.

       adduser  takes  special  attention to be directly usable in Debian maintainer scripts without conditional wrappers,
       error suppression and other scaffolding.  The only thing that the package maintainer should need to code is a check
       for the presence of the executable in the postrm script.  The adduser maintainers consider the need for  additional
       scaffolding a bug and encourage their fellow Debian package maintainers to file bugs against the adduser package in
       this case.

NAME
       alsaucm - ALSA Use Case Manager

SYNOPSIS
       alsaucm <options> [command]

DESCRIPTION
       alsaucm (ALSA Use Case Manager) is a program to use the ALSA Use Case Interface from the command line.

       On complex sound cards, setting up audio routes is not trivial and mixer settings can conflict one another prevent‐
       ing the audio card to work at all.

       The ALSA Use Case Manager is a mechanism for controlling complex audio hardware establishing a relationship between
       hardware configurations and meaningful use cases that the end-user can relate with.

       The use case manager can also be used to switch between use cases when necessary, in a consistent way.

       At  a  lower  level, the use case manager works by configuring the sound card ALSA kcontrols to change the hardware
       digital and analog audio routing to match the requested device use case.

       The use case manager kcontrol configurations are stored in easy to modify text files. An audio use case can be  de‐
       fined by a verb and device parameter.

       The verb describes the use case action i.e. a phone call, listening to music, recording a conversation etc. The de‐
       vice  describes the physical audio capture and playback hardware i.e. headphones, phone handset, bluetooth headset,
       etc.

                 The value of the IDENTIFIER argument can be:

                 • _verb - set the verb to VALUE

                 • _enadev - enable the device specified by VALUE

                 • _disdev - disable the device specified by VALUE

                 • _swdev/{old_device} - switche device:

                   • disable old_device and then enable the device specified by VALUE

                   • if no device was enabled just return

                 • _enamod - enable the modifier specified by VALUE

                 • _swmod/{old_modifier} - switch modifier:

                   • disable old_modifier and then enable the modifier specified by VALUE

                   • if no modifier was enabled just return

                 Note that the identifiers referring to devices and modifiers are valid only after setting a verb.

          h, help
                 help

          q, quit
                 quit

FILES
       The master use case files for each supported sound card are in /usr/share/alsa/ucm.

       For example, the master use case file for the Pandaboard card is in /usr/share/alsa/ucm/PandaBoard/PandaBoard.conf,
       this file lists all the supported use cases, e.g.

          SectionUseCase."HiFi" {
                          File "hifi"
                          Comment "Play HiFi quality Music."
          }
          ...

       Each use case defines a _verb, which is described in the file specified in the File directive, like above.

       The HiFi verb above is described in /usr/share/alsa/ucm/PandaBoard/hifi.

       For    more    details    on    the    syntax    of    UCM    files,    see    the    alsa-lib     source     code:
       http://git.alsa-project.org/?p=alsa-lib.git;a=blob;f=src/ucm/parser.c

EXAMPLES OF USE
       Some  commands, like for instance list _devices, can only work after setting a _verb in the same execution, for in‐
       stance this sequence doesn't work:

          # alsaucm -c bytcr-rt5640 set _verb HiFi
          # alsaucm -c bytcr-rt5640 list _devices

       However this command does:

          # alsaucm -n -b - <<EOM
          open bytcr-rt5640
          set _verb HiFi
          list _devices
          EOM

       An example of setting the Speaker device for the HiFi verb of the bytcr-rt5640 card:

          # alsaucm -n -b - <<EOM
          open bytcr-rt5640
          reset
          set _verb HiFi
          set _enadev Speaker
          EOM

APROPOS(1)                                          Manual pager utils                                          APROPOS(1)

NAME
       apropos - search the manual page names and descriptions

SYNOPSIS
       apropos [-dalv?V] [-e|-w|-r] [-s list] [-m system[,...]] [-M path] [-L locale] [-C file] keyword ...

DESCRIPTION
       Each  manual  page has a short description available within it.  apropos searches the descriptions for instances of
       keyword.

       keyword is usually a regular expression, as if (-r) was used, or may contain wildcards (-w),  or  match  the  exact
       keyword  (-e).   Using these options, it may be necessary to quote the keyword or escape (\) the special characters
       to stop the shell from interpreting them.

       The standard matching rules allow matches to be made against the page name and word boundaries in the description.

       The database searched by apropos is updated by the mandb program.  Depending on your installation, this may be  run
       by a periodic cron job, or may need to be run manually after new manual pages have been installed.

OPTIONS
       -d, --debug
              Print debugging information.

       -v, --verbose
              Print verbose warning messages.

       -r, --regex
              Interpret  each  keyword  as  a  regular  expression.   This is the default behaviour.  Each keyword will be
              matched against the page names and the descriptions independently.  It can match any part  of  either.   The
              match is not limited to word boundaries.

       -w, --wildcard
              Interpret  each keyword as a pattern containing shell style wildcards.  Each keyword will be matched against
              the page names and the descriptions independently.  If --exact is also used, a match will only be  found  if
              an  expanded  keyword  matches an entire description or page name.  Otherwise the keyword is also allowed to
              match on word boundaries in the description.

       -e, --exact
              Each keyword will be exactly matched against the page names and the descriptions.

       -a, --and
              Only display items that match all the supplied keywords.  The default is to display  items  that  match  any
              keyword.

       -l, --long
              Do not trim output to the terminal width.  Normally, output will be truncated to the terminal width to avoid
              ugly results from poorly-written NAME sections.

       -s list, --sections=list, --section=list
              Search  only  the given manual sections.  list is a colon- or comma-separated list of sections.  If an entry
              in list is a simple section, for example "3", then the displayed list of descriptions will include pages  in
              sections  "3",  "3perl",  "3x",  and so on; while if an entry in list has an extension, for example "3perl",
              then the list will only include pages in that exact part of the manual section.

       -m system[,...], --systems=system[,...]
              If this system has access to other operating systems' manual page descriptions, they can be  searched  using
              this option.  To search NewOS's manual page descriptions, use the option -m NewOS.

              The system specified can be a combination of comma-delimited operating system names.  To include a search of
              the native operating system's whatis descriptions, include the system name man in the argument string.  This
              option will override the $SYSTEM environment variable.

       -M path, --manpath=path
              Specify an alternate set of colon-delimited manual page hierarchies to search.  By default, apropos uses the
              $MANPATH  environment  variable, unless it is empty or unset, in which case it will determine an appropriate
              manpath based on your $PATH environment variable.  This option overrides the contents of $MANPATH.

       -L locale, --locale=locale
              apropos will normally determine your current locale by a call to the C function setlocale(3) which  interro‐
              gates various environment variables, possibly including $LC_MESSAGES and $LANG.  To temporarily override the
              determined value, use this option to supply a locale string directly to apropos.  Note that it will not take
              effect until the search for pages actually begins.  Output such as the help message will always be displayed
              in the initially determined locale.

       -C file, --config-file=file
              Use this user configuration file rather than the default of ~/.manpath.

       -?, --help
              Print a help message and exit.

       --usage
              Print a short usage message and exit.

       -V, --version
              Display version information.

EXIT STATUS
       0      Successful program execution.

       1      Usage, syntax or configuration file error.

       2      Operational error.

       16     Nothing was found that matched the criteria specified.

ENVIRONMENT
       SYSTEM If  $SYSTEM  is  set, it will have the same effect as if it had been specified as the argument to the -m op‐
              tion.

       MANPATH
              If $MANPATH is set, its value is interpreted as the colon-delimited manual page  hierarchy  search  path  to
              use.

              See  the  SEARCH  PATH  section  of manpath(5) for the default behaviour and details of how this environment
              variable is handled.

       MANWIDTH
              If $MANWIDTH is set, its value is used as the terminal width (see the --long option).  If it is not set, the
              terminal width will be calculated using the value of $COLUMNS, and ioctl(2) if available, or falling back to
              80 characters if all else fails.

       POSIXLY_CORRECT
              If $POSIXLY_CORRECT is set, even to a null value, the default apropos search will be as  an  extended  regex
              (-r).  Nowadays, this is the default behaviour anyway.

NAME
       arecordmidi - record Standard MIDI Files

SYNOPSIS
       arecordmidi -p client:port[,...] [options] midifile

DESCRIPTION
       arecordmidi is a command-line utility that records a Standard MIDI File from one or more ALSA sequencer ports.

       To stop recording, press Ctrl+C.

OPTIONS
       -h,--help
              Prints a list of options.

       -V,--version
              Prints the current version.

       -l,--list
              Prints a list of possible input ports.

       -p,--port=client:port,...
              Sets the sequencer port(s) from which events are recorded.

              A  client can be specified by its number, its name, or a prefix of its name. A port is specified by its num‐
              ber; for port 0 of a client, the ":0" part of the port specification can be omitted.

       -b,--bpm=beats
              Sets the musical tempo of the MIDI file, in beats per minute.  The default value is 120 BPM.

       -f,--fps=frames
              Sets the SMPTE resolution, in frames per second.  Possible values are 24, 25, 29.97 (for 30 drop-frame), and
              30.

       -t,--ticks=ticks
              Sets the resolution of timestamps (ticks) in the MIDI file, in ticks per beat (when using musical tempo)  or
              ticks  per  frame (when using SMPTE timing).  The default value is 384 ticks/beat or 40 ticks/frame, respec‐
              tively.

       -s,--split-channels
              Specifies that the data for each MIDI channel should be written to a separate track in the MIDI file.   This
              will  result  in  a  "format  1" file.  Otherwise, when there is only one track, arecordmidi will generate a
              "format 0" file.

       -m,--metronome=client:port
              Plays a metronome signal on the specified sequencer port.

              Metronome sounds are played on channel 10, MIDI notes 33 & 34 (GM2/GS/XG metronome standard notes), with ve‐
              locity 100 and duration 1.

       -i,--timesig=numerator:denominator
              Sets the time signature for the MIDI file and metronome.

              The time signature is specified as usual with two numbers, representing the numerator and denominator of the
              time signature as it would be notated. The denominator must be a power of two. Both numbers should be  sepa‐
              rated by a colon. The time signature is 4:4 by default.

avahi-daemon(8)                                   System Manager's Manual                                  avahi-daemon(8)

NAME
       avahi-daemon - The Avahi mDNS/DNS-SD daemon

SYNOPSIS
       avahi-daemon [options]

       avahi-daemon --kill

       avahi-daemon --reload

       avahi-daemon --check

DESCRIPTION
       The  Avahi  mDNS/DNS-SD  daemon implements Apple's Zeroconf architecture (also known as "Rendezvous" or "Bonjour").
       The daemon registers local IP addresses and static services using mDNS/DNS-SD and provides two IPC APIs  for  local
       programs to make use of the mDNS record cache the avahi-daemon maintains. First there is the so called "simple pro‐
       tocol" which is used exclusively by avahi-dnsconfd (a daemon which configures unicast DNS servers using server info
       published  via  mDNS) and nss-mdns (a libc NSS plugin, providing name resolution via mDNS). Finally there is the D-
       Bus interface which provides a rich object oriented interface to D-Bus enabled applications.

       Upon startup avahi-daemon interprets its configuration file /etc/avahi/avahi-daemon.conf and  reads  XML  fragments
       from  /etc/avahi/services/*.service which may define static DNS-SD services. If you enable publish-resolv-conf-dns-
       servers in avahi-daemon.conf the file /etc/resolv.conf will be read, too.

OPTIONS
       -f | --file= FILE
              Specify the configuration file to read. (default: /etc/avahi/avahi-daemon.conf)

       -D | --daemonize
              Daemonize after startup. Implies --syslog.

       -s | --syslog
              Log to syslog instead of STDERR. Implied by --daemonize.

       --debug
              Increase verbosity to debug level.

       --no-rlimits
              Don't enforce resource limits as specified in the configuration file. (See setrlimit(2)  for  more  informa‐
              tion)

       --no-drop-root
              Don't drop root privileges after startup and don't require daemon to be started as root. We recommend not to
              use this option.

       --no-chroot
              Don't chroot(2) the daemon. This option is only available when compiled with chroot() support.

       --no-proc-title
              Don't  change  the process name while running. Unless this option is specified avahi-daemon will reflect its
              current state and the selected host name in the process title.

       -k | --kill
              Kill an already running avahi-daemon. (equivalent to sending a SIGTERM)

       -r | --reload
              Tell an already running avahi-daemon to reread /etc/resolv.conf (in case  you  enabled  publish-resolv-conf-
              dns-servers in avahi-daemon.conf) the files from /etc/avahi/services/. Please note that this will not reload
              the /etc/avahi/avahi-daemon.conf. (equivalent to sending a SIGHUP)

       -c | --check
              Return 0 as return code when avahi-daemon is already running.

       -h | --help
              Show help

       -v | --version
              Show version information

FILES
       /etc/avahi/avahi-daemon.conf: the default configuration file for avahi-daemon, avahi-daemon.conf(5) for more infor‐
       mation.

       /etc/avahi/hosts: additional static hostname mappings to publish in mDNS, see avahi.hosts(5) for more information.

       /etc/avahi/services/*.service: static service definitions, see avahi.service(5) for more information.

SIGNALS
       SIGINT, SIGTERM: avahi-daemon will shutdown. (Same as --kill).

       SIGHUP:  avahi-daemon will reload unicast DNS server data from /etc/resolv.conf and static service definitions from
       /etc/avahi/services/. (Same as --reload)

       SIGUSR1: avahi-daemon will dump local and remote cached resource record data to syslog.

AMIDI(1)                                          General Commands Manual                                         AMIDI(1)

NAME
       amidi - read from and write to ALSA RawMIDI ports

SYNOPSIS
       amidi [-p port] [-s file | -S data] [-r file] [-d] [-t seconds] [-a]

DESCRIPTION
       amidi is a command-line utility which allows one to receive and send SysEx (system exclusive) data from/to external
       MIDI devices.  It can also send any other MIDI commands.

       amidi handles only files containing raw MIDI commands, without timing information.  amidi does not support Standard
       MIDI (.mid) files, but aplaymidi(1) and arecordmidi(1) do.

OPTIONS
       Use  the  -h, -V, -l, or -L options to display information; or use at least one of the -s, -r, -S, or -d options to
       specify what data to send or receive.

       -h, --help
              Help: prints a list of options.

       -V, --version
              Prints the current version.

       -l, --list-devices
              Prints a list of all hardware MIDI ports.

       -L, --list-rawmidis
              Prints all RawMIDI definitions.  (used when debugging configuration files)

       -p, --port=name
              Sets the name of the ALSA RawMIDI port to use.  If this is not specified, amidi uses the  default  port  de‐
              fined in the configuration file (the default for this is port 0 on card 0, which may not exist).

       -s, --send=filename
              Sends  the contents of the specified file to the MIDI port.  The file must contain raw MIDI commands (e.g. a
              .syx file); for Standard MIDI (.mid) files, use aplaymidi(1).

       -r, --receive=filename
              Writes data received from the MIDI port into the specified file.  The file will contain  raw  MIDI  commands
              (such as in a .syx file); to record a Standard MIDI (.mid) file, use arecordmidi(1).

              amidi  will  filter out any Active Sensing and Clock bytes (FEh, F8h), unless the -a or -c options have been
              given.

       -S, --send-hex="..."
              Sends the bytes specified as hexadecimal numbers to the MIDI port.

       -d, --dump
              Prints data received from the MIDI port as hexadecimal bytes.  Active Sensing and  Clock  bytes  (FEh,  F8h)
              will not be shown, unless the -a or -c options have been given.

              This option is useful for debugging.

       -t, --timeout=seconds
              Stops receiving data when no data has been received for the specified amount of time.

              If this option has not been given, you must press Ctrl+C (or kill amidi) to stop receiving data.

       -a, --active-sensing
              Does not ignore Active Sensing bytes (FEh) when saving or printing received MIDI commands.

       -c, --clock
              Does not ignore Clock bytes (F8h) when saving or printing received MIDI commands.

       -i, --sysex-interval=mseconds
              Adds  a delay in between each SysEx message sent to a device. It is useful when sending firmware updates via
              SysEx messages to a remote device.

EXAMPLES
       amidi -p hw:0 -s my_settings.syx
              will send the MIDI commands in my_settings.syx to port hw:0.

       amidi -p hw:1,0,0 -s firmware.syx -i 100
              will send the MIDI commands in firmware.syx to port hw:1,0,0 with 100 milliseconds delay in between each Sy‐
              sEx message.

       amidi -S 'F0 43 10 4C 00 00 7E 00 F7'
              sends an XG Reset to the default port.

       amidi -p hw:1,2 -S F0411042110C000000000074F7 -r dump.syx -t 1
              sends a “Parameter Dump Request” to a GS device, saves the received parameter data to the file dump.syx, and
              stops after the device has finished sending data (when no data has been received for one second).

       amidi -p virtual -d
              creates a virtual RawMIDI port and prints all data sent to this port.

FILES
       /usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf default rawmidi definitions
       /etc/asound.conf system-wide rawmidi definitions
       ~/.asoundrc user specific rawmidi definitions

APT(8)                                                      APT                                                     APT(8)

NAME
       apt - command-line interface

SYNOPSIS

       apt [-h] [-o=config_string] [-c=config_file] [-t=target_release] [-a=architecture] {list | search | show | update |
           install pkg [{=pkg_version_number | /target_release}]...  | remove pkg...  | upgrade | full-upgrade |
           edit-sources | {-v | --version} | {-h | --help}}

DESCRIPTION
       apt provides a high-level commandline interface for the package management system. It is intended as an end user
       interface and enables some options better suited for interactive usage by default compared to more specialized APT
       tools like apt-get(8) and apt-cache(8).

       Much like apt itself, its manpage is intended as an end user interface and as such only mentions the most used
       commands and options partly to not duplicate information in multiple places and partly to avoid overwhelming
       readers with a cornucopia of options and details.

       update (apt-get(8))
           update is used to download package information from all configured sources. Other commands operate on this data
           to e.g. perform package upgrades or search in and display details about all packages available for
           installation.

       upgrade (apt-get(8))
           upgrade is used to install available upgrades of all packages currently installed on the system from the
           sources configured via sources.list(5). New packages will be installed if required to satisfy dependencies, but
           existing packages will never be removed. If an upgrade for a package requires the removal of an installed
           package the upgrade for this package isn't performed.

           When a package is supplied as an argument, the package will be installed prior to the upgrade action.

       full-upgrade (apt-get(8))
           full-upgrade performs the function of upgrade but will remove currently installed packages if this is needed to
           upgrade the system as a whole.

           When a package is supplied as an argument, the package will be installed prior to the upgrade action.

       install, reinstall, remove, purge (apt-get(8))
           Performs the requested action on one or more packages specified via regex(7), glob(7) or exact match. The
           requested action can be overridden for specific packages by appending a plus (+) to the package name to install
           this package or a minus (-) to remove it.

           A specific version of a package can be selected for installation by following the package name with an equals
           (=) and the version of the package to select. Alternatively the version from a specific release can be selected
           by following the package name with a forward slash (/) and codename (bookworm, trixie, sid ...) or suite name
           (stable, testing, unstable). This will also select versions from this release for dependencies of this package
           if needed to satisfy the request.

           Removing a package removes all packaged data, but leaves usually small (modified) user configuration files
           behind, in case the remove was an accident. Just issuing an installation request for the accidentally removed
           package will restore its function as before in that case. On the other hand you can get rid of these leftovers
           by calling purge even on already removed packages. Note that this does not affect any data or configuration
           stored in your home directory.

       autoremove (apt-get(8))
           autoremove is used to remove packages that were automatically installed to satisfy dependencies for other
           packages and are now no longer needed as dependencies changed or the package(s) needing them were removed in
           the meantime.

           You should check that the list does not include applications you have grown to like even though they were once
           installed just as a dependency of another package. You can mark such a package as manually installed by using
           apt-mark(8). Packages which you have installed explicitly via install are also never proposed for automatic
           removal.

       satisfy (apt-get(8))
           satisfy satisfies dependency strings, as used in Build-Depends. It also handles conflicts, by prefixing an
           argument with "Conflicts: ".

           Example: apt satisfy "foo, bar (>= 1.0)" "Conflicts: baz, fuzz"

       search (apt-cache(8))
           search can be used to search for the given regex(7) term(s) in the list of available packages and display
           matches. This can e.g. be useful if you are looking for packages having a specific feature. If you are looking
           for a package including a specific file try apt-file(1).

       show (apt-cache(8))
           Show information about the given package(s) including its dependencies, installation and download size, sources
           the package is available from, the description of the packages content and much more. It can e.g. be helpful to
           look at this information before allowing apt(8) to remove a package or while searching for new packages to
           install.

       list
           list is somewhat similar to dpkg-query --list in that it can display a list of packages satisfying certain
           criteria. It supports glob(7) patterns for matching package names, apt-patterns(7), as well as options to list
           installed (--installed), upgradeable (--upgradeable) or all available (--all-versions) versions.

       edit-sources (work-in-progress)
           edit-sources lets you edit your sources.list(5) files in your preferred text editor while also providing basic
           sanity checks.

       showsrc, depends, rdepends, policy (summarised in apt-cache(8))

       source, build-dep, download, changelog, clean, distclean, autoclean (summarised in apt-get(8))

SCRIPT USAGE AND DIFFERENCES FROM OTHER APT TOOLS
       The apt(8) commandline is designed as an end-user tool and it may change behavior between versions. While it tries
       not to break backward compatibility this is not guaranteed either if a change seems beneficial for interactive use.

       All features of apt(8) are available in dedicated APT tools like apt-get(8) and apt-cache(8) as well.  apt(8) just
       changes the default value of some options (see apt.conf(5) and specifically the Binary scope). So you should prefer
       using these commands (potentially with some additional options enabled) in your scripts as they keep backward
       compatibility as much as possible.

GAWK(1)                                              Utility Commands                                              GAWK(1)

NAME
       gawk - pattern scanning and processing language

SYNOPSIS
       gawk [ POSIX or GNU style options ] -f program-file [ -- ] file ...
       gawk [ POSIX or GNU style options ] [ -- ] program-text file ...

DESCRIPTION
       Gawk  is  the  GNU  Project's implementation of the AWK programming language.  It conforms to the definition of the
       language in the POSIX 1003.1 standard.  This version in turn is based on the description  in  The  AWK  Programming
       Language, by Aho, Kernighan, and Weinberger.  Gawk provides the additional features found in the current version of
       Brian Kernighan's awk and numerous GNU-specific extensions.

       The  command line consists of options to gawk itself, the AWK program text (if not supplied via the -f or --include
       options), and values to be made available in the ARGC and ARGV pre-defined AWK variables.

PREFACE
       This manual page is intentionally as terse as possible.  Full details are provided in GAWK: Effective AWK  Program‐
       ming,  and  you  should look there for the full story on any specific feature.  Where possible, links to the online
       version of the manual are provided.

OPTION FORMAT
       Gawk options may be either traditional POSIX-style one letter options, or GNU-style long  options.   POSIX  options
       start  with a single “-”, while long options start with “--”.  Long options are provided for both GNU-specific fea‐
       tures and for POSIX-mandated features.

       Gawk-specific options are typically used in long-option form.  Arguments to long options are either joined with the
       option by an = sign, with no intervening spaces, or they may be provided in the next command line  argument.   Long
       options may be abbreviated, as long as the abbreviation remains unique.

       Additionally,  every  long  option has a corresponding short option, so that the option's functionality may be used
       from within #!  executable scripts.

OPTIONS
       Gawk accepts the following options.  Standard options are listed first, followed by options  for  gawk  extensions,
       listed alphabetically by short option.

       -f program-file, --file program-file
              Read  the  AWK  program  source from the file program-file, instead of from the first command line argument.
              Multiple -f options may be used.  Files read with -f are treated as if they begin with  an  implicit  @name‐
              space "awk" statement.

       -F fs, --field-separator fs
              Use fs for the input field separator (the value of the FS predefined variable).

       -v var=val, --assign var=val
              Assign  the value val to the variable var, before execution of the program begins.  Such variable values are
              available to the BEGIN rule of an AWK program.

       -b, --characters-as-bytes
              Treat all input data as single-byte characters.  The --posix option overrides this one.

       -c, --traditional
              Run in compatibility mode.  In compatibility mode, gawk behaves identically to Brian Kernighan's  awk;  none
              of the GNU-specific extensions are recognized.

       -C, --copyright
              Print  the  short  version of the GNU copyright information message on the standard output and exit success‐
              fully.

       -d[file], --dump-variables[=file]
              Print a sorted list of global variables, their types and final values to file.  The  default  file  is  awk‐
              vars.out in the current directory.

       -D[file], --debug[=file]
              Enable  debugging  of AWK programs.  By default, the debugger reads commands interactively from the keyboard
              (standard input).  The optional file argument specifies a file with a list of commands for the  debugger  to
              execute non-interactively.
              In this mode of execution, gawk loads the AWK source code and then prompts for debugging commands.  Gawk can
              only  debug  AWK  program  source provided with the -f and --include options.  The debugger is documented in
              GAWK: Effective AWK Programming; see https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Debugger.html#Debug‐
              ger.

       -e program-text, --source program-text
              Use program-text as AWK program source code.  Each argument supplied via -e is treated as if it begins  with
              an implicit @namespace "awk" statement.

       -E file, --exec file
              Similar  to  -f,  however,  this is option is the last one processed.  This should be used with #!  scripts,
              particularly for CGI applications, to avoid passing in options or source code (!) on the command line from a
              URL.  This option disables command-line variable assignments.

       -g, --gen-pot
              Scan and parse the AWK program, and generate a GNU .pot (Portable Object Template) format file  on  standard
              output with entries for all localizable strings in the program.  The program itself is not executed.

       -h, --help
              Print  a relatively short summary of the available options on the standard output.  Per the GNU Coding Stan‐
              dards, these options cause an immediate, successful exit.

       -i include-file, --include include-file
              Load an awk source library.  This searches for the library using the AWKPATH environment variable.   If  the
              initial search fails, another attempt will be made after appending the .awk suffix.  The file will be loaded
              only  once  (i.e.,  duplicates  are  eliminated),  and the code does not constitute the main program source.
              Files read with --include are treated as if they begin with an implicit @namespace "awk" statement.

       -I, --trace
              Print the internal byte code names as they are executed when running the program. The trace  is  printed  to
              standard error. Each ``op code'' is preceded by a + sign in the output.

       -l lib, --load lib
              Load a gawk extension from the shared library lib.  This searches for the library using the AWKLIBPATH envi‐
              ronment  variable.   If  the  initial search fails, another attempt will be made after appending the default
              shared library suffix for the platform.   The  library  initialization  routine  is  expected  to  be  named
              dl_load().

       -L [value], --lint[=value]
              Provide  warnings  about  constructs  that  are  dubious  or non-portable to other AWK implementations.  See
              https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Options.html#Options for the list of possible values  for
              value.

       -M, --bignum
              Force  arbitrary  precision  arithmetic on numbers. This option has no effect if gawk is not compiled to use
              the GNU MPFR and GMP libraries.  (In such a case, gawk issues a warning.)

              NOTE: This feature is on parole.  The primary gawk maintainer is no longer supporting it, although there  is
              a member of the development team who is. If this situation changes, the feature will be removed from gawk.

       -n, --non-decimal-data
              Recognize octal and hexadecimal values in input data.  Use this option with great caution!

       -N, --use-lc-numeric
              Force gawk to use the locale's decimal point character when parsing input data.

       -o[file], --pretty-print[=file]
              Output  a pretty printed version of the program to file.  The default file is awkprof.out in the current di‐
              rectory.  This option implies --no-optimize.

       -O, --optimize
              Enable gawk's default optimizations upon the internal representation of the program.  This option is  on  by
              default.

       -p[prof-file], --profile[=prof-file]
              Start a profiling session, and send the profiling data to prof-file.  The default is awkprof.out in the cur‐
              rent  directory.   The profile contains execution counts of each statement in the program in the left margin
              and function call counts for each user-defined function.  Gawk runs more slowly in this mode.   This  option
              implies --no-optimize.

       -P, --posix
              This turns on compatibility mode, and disables a number of common extensions.

       -r, --re-interval
              Enable  the use of interval expressions in regular expression matching.  Interval expressions are enabled by
              default, but this option remains for backwards compatibility.

       -s, --no-optimize
              Disable gawk's default optimizations upon the internal representation of the program.

       -S, --sandbox
              Run gawk in sandbox mode, disabling the system() function, input redirection with getline,  output  redirec‐
              tion  with  print and printf, and loading dynamic extensions.  Command execution (through pipelines) is also
              disabled.

       -t, --lint-old
              Provide warnings about constructs that are not portable to the original version of UNIX awk.

       -V, --version
              Print version information for this particular copy of gawk on the standard output.  This is useful when  re‐
              porting bugs.  Per the GNU Coding Standards, these options cause an immediate, successful exit.

       --     Signal the end of options. This is useful to allow further arguments to the AWK program itself to start with
              a “-”.

       In  compatibility  mode, any other options are flagged as invalid, but are otherwise ignored.  In normal operation,
       as long as program text has been supplied, unknown options are passed on to the AWK program in the ARGV  array  for
       processing.

       For POSIX compatibility, the -W option may be used, followed by the name of a long option.

AWK PROGRAM EXECUTION
       An AWK program consists of a sequence of optional directives, pattern-action statements, and optional function def‐
       initions.

              @include "filename"
              @load "filename"
              @namespace "name"
              pattern   { action statements }
              function name(parameter list) { statements }

       Gawk  first reads the program source from the program-file(s) if specified, from arguments to --source, or from the
       first non-option argument on the command line.  The -f and --source options may be used multiple times on the  com‐
       mand line.  Gawk reads the program text as if all the program-files and command line source texts had been concate‐
       nated together.

       In  addition,  lines  beginning with @include may be used to include other source files into your program.  This is
       equivalent to using the --include option.

       Lines beginning with @load may be used to load extension functions into your program.  This is equivalent to  using
       the --load option.

       The  environment  variable  AWKPATH  specifies a search path to use when finding source files named with the -f and
       --include options.  If this variable does not exist, the default path is ".:/usr/local/share/awk".  (The actual di‐
       rectory may vary, depending upon how gawk was built and installed.)  If a file name given to the -f option contains
       a “/” character, no path search is performed.

       The environment variable AWKLIBPATH specifies a search path to use when finding source files named with the  --load
       option.   If  this  variable  does not exist, the default path is "/usr/local/lib/gawk".  (The actual directory may
       vary, depending upon how gawk was built and installed.)

       Gawk executes AWK programs in the following order.  First, all variable assignments specified via the -v option are
       performed.  Next, gawk compiles the program into an internal form.  Then, gawk  executes  the  code  in  the  BEGIN
       rule(s)  (if  any), and then proceeds to read each file named in the ARGV array (up to ARGV[ARGC-1]).  If there are
       no files named on the command line, gawk reads the standard input.

       If a filename on the command line has the form var=val it is treated as a variable assignment.   The  variable  var
       will be assigned the value val.  (This happens after any BEGIN rule(s) have been run.)

       If the value of a particular element of ARGV is empty (""), gawk skips over it.

       For  each  input file, if a BEGINFILE rule exists, gawk executes the associated code before processing the contents
       of the file. Similarly, gawk executes the code associated with ENDFILE rules after processing the file.

       For each record in the input, gawk tests to see if it matches any pattern in the AWK  program.   For  each  pattern
       that  the  record matches, gawk executes the associated action.  The patterns are tested in the order they occur in
       the program.

       Finally, after all the input is exhausted, gawk executes the code in the END rule(s) (if any).

   Command Line Directories
       According to POSIX, files named on the awk command line must be text files.  The behavior is ``undefined'' if  they
       are not.  Most versions of awk treat a directory on the command line as a fatal error.

       For  gawk,  a directory on the command line produces a warning, but is otherwise skipped.  If either of the --posix
       or --traditional options is given, then gawk reverts to treating directories on the command line as a fatal error.

VARIABLES, RECORDS AND FIELDS
       AWK variables are dynamic; they come into existence when they are first used.  Their values  are  either  floating-
       point  numbers  or strings, or both, depending upon how they are used.  Additionally, gawk allows variables to have
       regular-expression type.  AWK also has one dimensional arrays; arrays with multiple dimensions  may  be  simulated.
       However,  gawk  provides true arrays of arrays.  Several pre-defined variables are set as a program runs; these are
       described as needed and summarized below.

   Records
       Normally, records are separated by newline characters.  You can control how records are separated by assigning val‐
       ues to the built-in variable RS.  See https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Records.html for  the  de‐
       tails.

   Fields
       As  each  input record is read, gawk splits the record into fields, using the value of the FS variable as the field
       separator.  Additionally, FIELDWIDTHS and FPAT may be used to control input  field  splitting.   See  the  details,
       starting at https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Fields.html.

       Each  field  in the input record may be referenced by its position: $1, $2, and so on.  $0 is the whole record, in‐
       cluding leading and trailing whitespace.

       The variable NF is set to the total number of fields in the input record.

       References to non-existent fields (i.e., fields after $NF) produce the null string.  However, assigning to  a  non-
       existent  field  (e.g., $(NF+2) = 5) increases the value of NF, creates any intervening fields with the null string
       as their values, and causes the value of $0 to be recomputed, with the fields being separated by the value of  OFS.
       References  to  negative numbered fields cause a fatal error.  Decrementing NF causes the values of fields past the
       new value to be lost, and the value of $0 to be recomputed, with the fields being separated by the value of OFS.

       Assigning a value to an existing field causes the whole record to be rebuilt when $0 is referenced.  Similarly, as‐
       signing a value to $0 causes the record to be resplit, creating new values for the fields.

   Built-in Variables
       Gawk's  built-in  variables   are   listed   below.    This   list   is   purposely   terse.   For   details,   see
       https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Built_002din-Variables.

       ARGC        The number of command line arguments.

       ARGIND      The index in ARGV of the current file being processed.

       ARGV        Array of command line arguments.  The array is indexed from 0 to ARGC - 1.

       BINMODE     On  non-POSIX  systems, specifies use of “binary” mode for all file I/O.  See https://www.gnu.org/soft‐
                   ware/gawk/manual/html_node/PC-Using.html for the details.

       CONVFMT     The conversion format for numbers, "%.6g", by default.

       ENVIRON     An array containing the values of the current environment.  The array is  indexed  by  the  environment
                   variables, each element being the value of that variable.

       ERRNO       If a system error occurs either doing a redirection for getline, during a read for getline, or during a
                   close(),  then  ERRNO  is set to a string describing the error.  The value is subject to translation in
                   non-English locales.

       FIELDWIDTHS A whitespace-separated list of field widths.  When set, gawk parses the  input  into  fields  of  fixed
                   width,  instead of using the value of the FS variable as the field separator.  Each field width may op‐
                   tionally be preceded by a colon-separated value specifying the number of characters to skip before  the
                   field starts.

       FILENAME    The  name of the current input file.  If no files are specified on the command line, the value of FILE‐
                   NAME is “-”.  However, FILENAME is undefined inside the BEGIN rule (unless set by getline).

       FNR         The input record number in the current input file.

       FPAT        A regular expression describing the contents of the fields in a record.  When set, gawk parses the  in‐
                   put into fields, where the fields match the regular expression, instead of using the value of FS as the
                   field separator.

       FS          The   input   field   separator,   a  space  by  default.   See  https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/man‐
                   ual/html_node/Field-Separators.html for the details.

       FUNCTAB     An array whose indices and corresponding values are the names of  all  the  user-defined  or  extension
                   functions in the program.  NOTE: You may not use the delete statement with the FUNCTAB array.

       IGNORECASE  Controls   the   case-sensitivity   of   all   regular   expression   and   string   operations.    See
                   https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Case_002dsensitivity.html for details.

       LINT        Provides dynamic control of the --lint option from within an AWK program.

       NF          The number of fields in the current input record.

       NR          The total number of input records seen so far.

       OFMT        The output format for numbers, "%.6g", by default.

       OFS         The output field separator, a space by default.

       ORS         The output record separator, by default a newline.

       PREC        The working precision of arbitrary precision floating-point numbers, 53 by default.

       PROCINFO    The elements of this  array  provide  access  to  information  about  the  running  AWK  program.   See
                   https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Auto_002dset for the details.

       ROUNDMODE   The  rounding  mode  to  use  for  arbitrary  precision arithmetic on numbers, by default "N" (IEEE-754
                   roundTiesToEven  mode).   See  https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Setting-the-rounding-
                   mode for the details.

       RS          The input record separator, by default a newline.

       RT          The record terminator.  Gawk sets RT to the input text that matched the character or regular expression
                   specified by RS.

       RSTART      The index of the first character matched by match(); 0 if no match.

       RLENGTH     The length of the string matched by match(); -1 if no match.

       SUBSEP      The string used to separate multiple subscripts in array elements, by default "\034".

       SYMTAB      An  array  whose indices are the names of all currently defined global variables and arrays in the pro‐
                   gram.  You may not use the delete statement with the SYMTAB array, nor assign to elements with an index
                   that is not a variable name.

       TEXTDOMAIN  The text domain of the AWK program; used to find the localized translations for the program's strings.

   Arrays
       Arrays are subscripted with an expression between square brackets ([ and ]).  If the expression  is  an  expression
       list  (expr,  expr ...)  then the array subscript is a string consisting of the concatenation of the (string) value
       of each expression, separated by the value of the SUBSEP variable.  This facility is used to simulate multiply  di‐
       mensioned arrays.  For example:

              i = "A"; j = "B"; k = "C"
              x[i, j, k] = "hello, world\n"

       assigns  the  string  "hello, world\n"  to the element of the array x which is indexed by the string "A\034B\034C".
       All arrays in AWK are associative, i.e., indexed by string values.

       The special operator in may be used to test if an array has an index consisting of a particular value:

              if (val in array)
                   print array[val]

       If the array has multiple subscripts, use (i, j) in array.

       The in construct may also be used in a for loop to iterate over all the elements of an array.  However, the (i,  j)
       in array construct only works in tests, not in for loops.

       An  element  may  be  deleted  from  an array using the delete statement.  The delete statement may also be used to
       delete the entire contents of an array, just by specifying the array name without a subscript.

       gawk supports true multidimensional arrays. It does not require that such arrays be ``rectangular'' as in C or C++.
       See https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Arrays for details.

   Namespaces
       Gawk provides a simple namespace facility to help work around the fact that all variables in AWK are global.

       A qualified name consists of a two simple identifiers joined by a double colon (::).  The left-hand identifier rep‐
       resents the namespace and the right-hand identifier is the variable within it.  All  simple  (non-qualified)  names
       are  considered to be in the ``current'' namespace; the default namespace is awk.  However, simple identifiers con‐
       sisting solely of uppercase letters are forced into the awk namespace, even if the current namespace is different.

       You change the current namespace with an @namespace "name" directive.

       The standard predefined builtin function names may not be used as namespace names.  The names of  additional  func‐
       tions  provided  by gawk may be used as namespace names or as simple identifiers in other namespaces.  For more de‐
       tails, see https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Namespaces.html#Namespaces.

   Variable Typing And Conversion
       Variables and fields may be (floating point) numbers, or strings, or both.  They may also be  regular  expressions.
       How  the  value of a variable is interpreted depends upon its context.  If used in a numeric expression, it will be
       treated as a number; if used as a string it will be treated as a string.

       To force a variable to be treated as a number, add zero to it; to force it to be treated as a  string,  concatenate
       it with the null string.

       Uninitialized variables have the numeric value zero and the string value "" (the null, or empty, string).

       When a string must be converted to a number, the conversion is accomplished using strtod(3).  A number is converted
       to a string by using the value of CONVFMT as a format string for sprintf(3), with the numeric value of the variable
       as  the argument.  However, even though all numbers in AWK are floating-point, integral values are always converted
       as integers.

       Gawk performs comparisons as follows: If two variables are numeric, they are compared numerically.  If one value is
       numeric and the other has a string value that is a “numeric string,” then comparisons are  also  done  numerically.
       Otherwise,  the  numeric value is converted to a string and a string comparison is performed.  Two strings are com‐
       pared, of course, as strings.

       Note that string constants, such as "57", are not numeric strings, they are string constants.  The idea of “numeric
       string” only applies to fields, getline input, FILENAME, ARGV elements, ENVIRON elements and the elements of an ar‐
       ray created by split() or patsplit() that are numeric strings.  The basic idea is that user input,  and  only  user
       input, that looks numeric, should be treated that way.

   Octal and Hexadecimal Constants
       You  may use C-style octal and hexadecimal constants in your AWK program source code.  For example, the octal value
       011 is equal to decimal 9, and the hexadecimal value 0x11 is equal to decimal 17.

   String Constants
       String constants in AWK are sequences of characters enclosed between double quotes (like "value").  Within strings,
       certain escape sequences are recognized, as in C.   See  https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Escape-
       Sequences for the details.

   Regexp Constants
       A regular expression constant is a sequence of characters enclosed between forward slashes (like /value/).

       The  escape  sequences  described  in  the  manual  may  also  be  used  inside constant regular expressions (e.g.,
       /[ \t\f\n\r\v]/ matches whitespace characters).

       Gawk provides strongly typed regular expression constants. These are written with a  leading  @  symbol  (like  so:
       @/value/).   Such constants may be assigned to scalars (variables, array elements) and passed to user-defined func‐
       tions. Variables that have been so assigned have regular expression type.

PATTERNS AND ACTIONS
       AWK is a line-oriented language.  The pattern comes first, and then the action.  Action statements are enclosed  in
       {  and  }.  Either the pattern may be missing, or the action may be missing, but, of course, not both.  If the pat‐
       tern is missing, the action executes for every single record of input.  A missing action is equivalent to

              { print }

       which prints the entire record.

       Comments begin with the # character, and continue until the end of the line.  Empty lines may be used  to  separate
       statements.   Normally, a statement ends with a newline, however, this is not the case for lines ending in a comma,
       {, ?, :, &&, or ||.  Lines ending in do or else also have their statements automatically continued on the following
       line.  In other cases, a line can be continued by ending it with a “\”, in which case the newline is ignored.  How‐
       ever, a “\” after a # is not special.

       Multiple statements may be put on one line by separating them with a “;”.  This  applies  to  both  the  statements
       within the action part of a pattern-action pair (the usual case), and to the pattern-action statements themselves.

   Patterns
       AWK patterns may be one of the following:

              BEGIN
              END
              BEGINFILE
              ENDFILE
              /regular expression/
              relational expression
              pattern && pattern
              pattern || pattern
              pattern ? pattern : pattern
              (pattern)
              ! pattern
              pattern1, pattern2

       BEGIN  and  END  are two special kinds of patterns which are not tested against the input.  The action parts of all
       BEGIN patterns are merged as if all the statements had been written in a single BEGIN rule.  They are executed  be‐
       fore  any  of  the  input is read.  Similarly, all the END rules are merged, and executed when all the input is ex‐
       hausted (or when an exit statement is executed).  BEGIN and END patterns cannot be combined with other patterns  in
       pattern expressions.  BEGIN and END patterns cannot have missing action parts.

       BEGINFILE and ENDFILE are additional special patterns whose actions are executed before reading the first record of
       each  command-line input file and after reading the last record of each file.  Inside the BEGINFILE rule, the value
       of ERRNO is the empty string if the file was opened successfully.  Otherwise, there is some problem with  the  file
       and  the  code  should  use nextfile to skip it. If that is not done, gawk produces its usual fatal error for files
       that cannot be opened.

       For /regular expression/ patterns, the associated statement is executed for each input record that matches the reg‐
       ular expression.  Regular expressions are essentially the same as those in egrep(1).  See https://www.gnu.org/soft‐
       ware/gawk/manual/html_node/Regexp.html for the details on regular expressions.

       A relational expression may use any of the operators defined below in the section on actions.  These generally test
       whether certain fields match certain regular expressions.

       The &&, ||, and !  operators are logical AND, logical OR, and logical NOT, respectively, as in C.  They  do  short-
       circuit  evaluation,  also as in C, and are used for combining more primitive pattern expressions.  As in most lan‐
       guages, parentheses may be used to change the order of evaluation.

       The ?: operator is like the same operator in C.  If the first pattern is true then the pattern used for testing  is
       the second pattern, otherwise it is the third.  Only one of the second and third patterns is evaluated.

       The pattern1, pattern2 form of an expression is called a range pattern.  It matches all input records starting with
       a  record  that matches pattern1, and continuing until a record that matches pattern2, inclusive.  It does not com‐
       bine with any other sort of pattern expression.

   Actions
       Action statements are enclosed in braces, { and }.  Action statements consist of the usual assignment, conditional,
       and looping statements found in most languages.  The operators, control  statements,  and  input/output  statements
       available are patterned after those in C.

   Operators
       The operators in AWK, in order of decreasing precedence, are:

       (...)       Grouping

       $           Field reference.

       ++ --       Increment and decrement, both prefix and postfix.

       ^           Exponentiation.

       + - !       Unary plus, unary minus, and logical negation.

       * / %       Multiplication, division, and modulus.

       + -         Addition and subtraction.

       space       String concatenation.

       |   |&      Piped I/O for getline, print, and printf.

       < > <= >= == !=
                   The regular relational operators.

       ~ !~        Regular expression match, negated match.

       in          Array membership.

       &&          Logical AND.

       ||          Logical OR.

       ?:          The C conditional expression.  This has the form expr1 ? expr2 : expr3.  If expr1 is true, the value of
                   the expression is expr2, otherwise it is expr3.  Only one of expr2 and expr3 is evaluated.

       = += -= *= /= %= ^=
                   Assignment.   Both absolute assignment (var = value) and operator-assignment (the other forms) are sup‐
                   ported.

   Control Statements
       The control statements are as follows:

              if (condition) statement [ else statement ]
              while (condition) statement
              do statement while (condition)
              for (expr1; expr2; expr3) statement
              for (var in array) statement
              break
              continue
              delete array[index]
              delete array
              exit [ expression ]
              { statements }
              switch (expression) {
              case value|regex : statement
              ...
              [ default: statement ]
              }

   I/O Statements
       The input/output statements are as follows:

       close(file [, how])   Close an open file, pipe or coprocess.  The optional how should only be used when closing one
                             end of a two-way pipe to a coprocess.  It must be a string value, either "to" or "from".

       getline               Set $0 from the next input record; set NF, NR, FNR, RT.

       getline <file         Set $0 from the next record of file; set NF, RT.

       getline var           Set var from the next input record; set NR, FNR, RT.

       getline var <file     Set var from the next record of file; set RT.

       command | getline [var]
                             Run command, piping the output either into $0 or var, as above, and RT.

       command |& getline [var]
                             Run command as a coprocess piping the output either into $0 or var, as above, and  RT.   (The
                             command can also be a socket.  See the subsection Special File Names, below.)

       fflush([file])        Flush  any  buffers associated with the open output file or pipe file.  If file is missing or
                             if it is the null string, then flush all open output files and pipes.

       next                  Stop processing the current input record.  Read the next input record  and  start  processing
                             over with the first pattern in the AWK program.  Upon reaching the end of the input data, ex‐
                             ecute any END rule(s).

       nextfile              Stop processing the current input file.  The next input record read comes from the next input
                             file.   Update  FILENAME and ARGIND, reset FNR to 1, and start processing over with the first
                             pattern in the AWK program.  Upon reaching the end of the input data, execute any ENDFILE and
                             END rule(s).

       print                 Print the current record.  The output record is terminated with the value of ORS.

       print expr-list       Print expressions.  Each expression is separated by the value of OFS.  The output  record  is
                             terminated with the value of ORS.

       print expr-list >file Print  expressions  on  file.   Each expression is separated by the value of OFS.  The output
                             record is terminated with the value of ORS.

       printf fmt, expr-list Format and print.

       printf fmt, expr-list >file
                             Format and print on file.

       system(cmd-line)      Execute the command cmd-line, and return the exit status.  (This may not be available on non-
                             POSIX   systems.)     See    https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/I_002fO-Func‐
                             tions.html#I_002fO-Functions for the full details on the exit status.

       Additional output redirections are allowed for print and printf.

       print ... >> file
              Append output to the file.

       print ... | command
              Write on a pipe.

       print ... |& command
              Send data to a coprocess or socket.  (See also the subsection Special File Names, below.)

       The getline command returns 1 on success, zero on end of file, and -1 on an error.  If the errno(3) value indicates
       that  the  I/O  operation may be retried, and PROCINFO["input", "RETRY"] is set, then -2 is returned instead of -1,
       and further calls to getline may be attempted.  Upon an error, ERRNO is set to a string describing the problem.

       NOTE: Failure in opening a two-way socket results in a non-fatal error being returned to the calling  function.  If
       using  a pipe, coprocess, or socket to getline, or from print or printf within a loop, you must use close() to cre‐
       ate new instances of the command or socket.  AWK does not automatically close pipes, sockets, or  coprocesses  when
       they return EOF.

       The  AWK  versions  of  the  printf  statement  and  sprintf() function are similar to those of C. For details, see
       https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Printf.html.

   Special File Names
       When doing I/O redirection from either print or printf into a file, or via getline from  a  file,  gawk  recognizes
       certain  special filenames internally.  These filenames allow access to open file descriptors inherited from gawk's
       parent process (usually the shell).  These file names may also be used on the command line to name data files.  The
       filenames are:

       -           The standard input.

       /dev/stdin  The standard input.

       /dev/stdout The standard output.

       /dev/stderr The standard error output.

       /dev/fd/n   The file associated with the open file descriptor n.

       The following special filenames may be used with the |& coprocess operator for creating TCP/IP network connections:

       /inet/tcp/lport/rhost/rport
       /inet4/tcp/lport/rhost/rport
       /inet6/tcp/lport/rhost/rport
              Files for a TCP/IP connection on local port lport to remote host rhost on remote port rport.  Use a port  of
              0  to have the system pick a port.  Use /inet4 to force an IPv4 connection, and /inet6 to force an IPv6 con‐
              nection.  Plain /inet uses the system default (most likely IPv4).  Usable only with the |& two-way I/O oper‐
              ator.

       /inet/udp/lport/rhost/rport
       /inet4/udp/lport/rhost/rport
       /inet6/udp/lport/rhost/rport
              Similar, but use UDP/IP instead of TCP/IP.

   Numeric Functions
       AWK has the following built-in arithmetic functions:

       atan2(y, x)   Return the arctangent of y/x in radians.

       cos(expr)     Return the cosine of expr, which is in radians.

       exp(expr)     The exponential function.

       int(expr)     Truncate to integer.

       log(expr)     The natural logarithm function.

       rand()        Return a random number N, between zero and one, such that 0 ≤ N < 1.

       sin(expr)     Return the sine of expr, which is in radians.

       sqrt(expr)    Return the square root of expr.

       srand([expr]) Use expr as the new seed for the random number generator.  If no expr is provided, use  the  time  of
                     day.  Return the previous seed for the random number generator.

   String Functions
       Gawk  has  the  following built-in string functions; details are provided in https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/man‐
       ual/html_node/String-Functions.

       asort(s [, d [, how] ]) Return the number of elements in the source array s.  Sort the contents of s  using  gawk's
                               normal  rules for comparing values, and replace the indices of the sorted values s with se‐
                               quential integers starting with 1. If the optional destination array d is specified,  first
                               duplicate  s  into d, and then sort d, leaving the indices of the source array s unchanged.
                               The optional string how controls the direction and the comparison mode.  Valid  values  for
                               how   are   described   in  https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/String-Func‐
                               tions.html#String-Functions.  s and d are allowed to be the same  array;  this  only  makes
                               sense when supplying the third argument as well.

       asorti(s [, d [, how] ])
                               Return  the  number of elements in the source array s.  The behavior is the same as that of
                               asort(), except that the array indices are used for sorting, not the  array  values.   When
                               done,  the  array is indexed numerically, and the values are those of the original indices.
                               The original values are lost; thus provide a second array if you wish to preserve the orig‐
                               inal.  The purpose of the optional string how is the same as for asort().  Here too, s  and
                               d are allowed to be the same array; this only makes sense when supplying the third argument
                               as well.

       gensub(r, s, h [, t])   Search  the  target string t for matches of the regular expression r.  If h is a string be‐
                               ginning with g or G, then replace all matches of r with s.  Otherwise, h is a number  indi‐
                               cating  which match of r to replace.  If t is not supplied, use $0 instead.  Within the re‐
                               placement text s, the sequence \n, where n is a digit from 1 to 9, may be used to  indicate
                               just  the  text  that matched the n'th parenthesized subexpression.  The sequence \0 repre‐
                               sents the entire matched text, as does the character &.  Unlike sub() and gsub(), the modi‐
                               fied string is returned as the result of the function, and the original  target  string  is
                               not changed.

       gsub(r, s [, t])        For each substring matching the regular expression r in the string t, substitute the string
                               s,  and return the number of substitutions.  If t is not supplied, use $0.  An & in the re‐
                               placement text is replaced with the text that was actually matched.  Use \& to get  a  lit‐
                               eral   &.   (This  must  be  typed  as  "\\&";  see  https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/man‐
                               ual/html_node/Gory-Details.html#Gory-Details for a fuller discussion of the rules  for  am‐
                               persands and backslashes in the replacement text of sub(), gsub(), and gensub().)

       index(s, t)             Return  the  index of the string t in the string s, or zero if t is not present.  (This im‐
                               plies that character indices start at one.)

       length([s])             Return the length of the string s, or the length of $0 if s is not supplied.  With an array
                               argument, length() returns the number of elements in the array.

       match(s, r [, a])       Return the position in s where the regular expression  r  occurs,  or  zero  if  r  is  not
                               present,  and  set  the  values of RSTART and RLENGTH.  Note that the argument order is the
                               same  as  for  the  ~  operator:  str  ~  re.   See  https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/man‐
                               ual/html_node/String-Functions.html#String-Functions  for  a description of how the array a
                               is filled if it is provided.

       patsplit(s, a [, r [, seps] ])
                               Split the string s into the array a and the separators array seps on the regular expression
                               r, and return the number of fields.  Element values are the portions of s that  matched  r.
                               The value of seps[i] is the possibly null separator that appeared after a[i].  The value of
                               seps[0]  is  the  possibly  null leading separator.  If r is omitted, FPAT is used instead.
                               The arrays a and seps are cleared first.  Splitting behaves identically to field  splitting
                               with FPAT.

       split(s, a [, r [, seps] ])
                               Split the string s into the array a and the separators array seps on the regular expression
                               r, and return the number of fields.  If r is omitted, FS is used instead.  The arrays a and
                               seps  are  cleared  first.   seps[i]  is  the field separator matched by r between a[i] and
                               a[i+1].  Splitting behaves identically to field splitting.

       sprintf(fmt, expr-list) Print expr-list according to fmt, and return the resulting string.

       strtonum(str)           Examine str, and return its numeric value.  If str begins with a leading 0, treat it as  an
                               octal  number.   If  str  begins with a leading 0x or 0X, treat it as a hexadecimal number.
                               Otherwise, assume it is a decimal number.

       sub(r, s [, t])         Just like gsub(), but replace only the first matching substring.   Return  either  zero  or
                               one.

       substr(s, i [, n])      Return the at most n-character substring of s starting at i.  If n is omitted, use the rest
                               of s.

       tolower(str)            Return  a  copy  of  the string str, with all the uppercase characters in str translated to
                               their corresponding lowercase counterparts.  Non-alphabetic characters are left unchanged.

       toupper(str)            Return a copy of the string str, with all the lowercase characters  in  str  translated  to
                               their corresponding uppercase counterparts.  Non-alphabetic characters are left unchanged.

       Gawk  is multibyte aware.  This means that index(), length(), substr() and match() all work in terms of characters,
       not bytes.

   Time Functions
       Gawk provides the following functions for obtaining time stamps  and  formatting  them.  Details  are  provided  in
       https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Time-Functions.

       mktime(datespec [, utc-flag])
                 Turn  datespec  into  a  time stamp of the same form as returned by systime(), and return the result.  If
                 utc-flag is present and is non-zero or non-null, the time is assumed to be in the UTC time  zone;  other‐
                 wise,  the time is assumed to be in the local time zone.  If datespec does not contain enough elements or
                 if the resulting time is out of range, mktime() returns -1.   See  https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/man‐
                 ual/html_node/Time-Functions.html#Time-Functions for the details of datespec.

       strftime([format [, timestamp[, utc-flag]]])
                 Format  timestamp  according  to  the specification in format.  If utc-flag is present and is non-zero or
                 non-null, the result is in UTC, otherwise the result is in local time.  The timestamp should  be  of  the
                 same form as returned by systime().  If timestamp is missing, the current time of day is used.  If format
                 is  missing,  a default format equivalent to the output of date(1) is used.  The default format is avail‐
                 able in PROCINFO["strftime"].  See the specification for the strftime() function in ISO C for the  format
                 conversions that are guaranteed to be available.

       systime() Return the current time of day as the number of seconds since the Epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC on POSIX
                 systems).

   Bit Manipulations Functions
       Gawk  supplies  the  following bit manipulation functions.  They work by converting double-precision floating point
       values to uintmax_t integers, doing the operation, and then converting the result back to floating point.   Passing
       negative operands to any of these functions causes a fatal error.

       The functions are:

       and(v1, v2 [, ...]) Return  the  bitwise  AND  of the values provided in the argument list.  There must be at least
                           two.

       compl(val)          Return the bitwise complement of val.

       lshift(val, count)  Return the value of val, shifted left by count bits.

       or(v1, v2 [, ...])  Return the bitwise OR of the values provided in the argument list.  There must be at least two.

       rshift(val, count)  Return the value of val, shifted right by count bits.

       xor(v1, v2 [, ...]) Return the bitwise XOR of the values provided in the argument list.  There  must  be  at  least
                           two.

   Type Functions
       The following functions provide type related information about their arguments.

       isarray(x) Return true if x is an array, false otherwise.

       typeof(x)  Return  a  string  indicating  the  type  of  x.  The string will be one of "array", "number", "regexp",
                  "string", "strnum", "unassigned", or "undefined".

   Internationalization Functions
       The following functions may be used from within your AWK program for translating strings at run-time.  For full de‐
       tails, see https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/I18N-Functions.html#I18N-Functions.

       bindtextdomain(directory [, domain])
              Specify the directory where gawk looks for the .gmo files, in case they will not or cannot be placed in  the
              ``standard'' locations.  It returns the directory where domain is ``bound.''
              The  default domain is the value of TEXTDOMAIN.  If directory is the null string (""), then bindtextdomain()
              returns the current binding for the given domain.

       dcgettext(string [, domain [, category]])
              Return the translation of string in text domain domain for locale category category.  The default value  for
              domain is the current value of TEXTDOMAIN.  The default value for category is "LC_MESSAGES".

       dcngettext(string1, string2, number [, domain [, category]])
              Return  the  plural form used for number of the translation of string1 and string2 in text domain domain for
              locale category category.  The default value for domain is the current value  of  TEXTDOMAIN.   The  default
              value for category is "LC_MESSAGES".

   Boolean Valued Functions
       You can create special Boolean-typed values; see the manual for how they work and why they exist.

       mkbool(expression)
              Based  on the boolean value of expression return either a true value or a false value.  True values have nu‐
              meric value one.  False values have numeric value zero.

USER-DEFINED FUNCTIONS
       Functions in AWK are defined as follows:

              function name(parameter list) { statements }

       Functions execute when they are called from within expressions in either patterns or  actions.   Actual  parameters
       supplied  in  the function call are used to instantiate the formal parameters declared in the function.  Arrays are
       passed by reference, other variables are passed by value.

       Local variables are declared as extra parameters in the parameter list.  The convention is to separate local  vari‐
       ables from real parameters by extra spaces in the parameter list.  For example:

              function  f(p, q,     a, b)   # a and b are local
              {
                   ...
              }

              /abc/     { ... ; f(1, 2) ; ... }

       The  left parenthesis in a function call is required to immediately follow the function name, without any interven‐
       ing whitespace.  This restriction does not apply to the built-in functions listed above.

       Functions may call each other and may be recursive.  Function parameters used as local variables are initialized to
       the null string and the number zero upon function invocation.

       Use return expr to return a value from a function.  The return value is undefined if no value is  provided,  or  if
       the function returns by “falling off” the end.

       Functions  may  be  called  indirectly. To do this, assign the name of the function to be called, as a string, to a
       variable.  Then use the variable as if it were the name of a function, prefixed with an @ sign, like so:
              function myfunc()
              {
                   print "myfunc called"
                   ...
              }

              {    ...
                   the_func = "myfunc"
                   @the_func()    # call through the_func to myfunc
                   ...
              }

       If --lint has been provided, gawk warns about calls to undefined functions at parse time, instead of at  run  time.
       Calling an undefined function at run time is a fatal error.

DYNAMICALLY LOADING NEW FUNCTIONS
       You can dynamically add new functions written in C or C++ to the running gawk interpreter with the @load statement.
       The   full   details  are  beyond  the  scope  of  this  manual  page;  see  https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/man‐
       ual/html_node/Dynamic-Extensions.html#Dynamic-Extensions.

SIGNALS
       The gawk profiler accepts two signals.  SIGUSR1 causes it to dump a profile and function call stack to the  profile
       file, which is either awkprof.out, or whatever file was named with the --profile option.  It then continues to run.
       SIGHUP causes gawk to dump the profile and function call stack and then exit.

INTERNATIONALIZATION
       String  constants  are sequences of characters enclosed in double quotes.  In non-English speaking environments, it
       is possible to mark strings in the AWK program as requiring translation to the local natural language. Such strings
       are marked in the AWK program with a leading underscore (“_”).  For example,

              gawk 'BEGIN { print "hello, world" }'

       always prints hello, world.  But,

              gawk 'BEGIN { print _"hello, world" }'

       might print bonjour, monde  in  France.   See  https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Internationaliza‐
       tion.html#Internationalization for the steps involved in producing and running a localizable AWK program.

GNU EXTENSIONS
       Gawk  has  a  too-large  number  of  extensions  to  POSIX  awk.   They  are described in https://www.gnu.org/soft‐
       ware/gawk/manual/html_node/POSIX_002fGNU.html.  All the extensions can be disabled by invoking gawk with the --tra‐
       ditional or --posix options.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The AWKPATH environment variable can be used to provide a list of directories that gawk searches when  looking  for
       files named via the -f, --file, -i and --include options, and the @include directive.  If the initial search fails,
       the path is searched again after appending .awk to the filename.

       The  AWKLIBPATH  environment  variable can be used to provide a list of directories that gawk searches when looking
       for files named via the -l and --load options.

       The GAWK_PERSIST_FILE environment variable, if present, specifies a file to use as the backing store for persistent
       memory.  This is an experimental feature.  See GAWK: Effective AWK Programming for the details.

       The GAWK_READ_TIMEOUT environment variable can be used to specify a timeout in milliseconds for reading input  from
       a terminal, pipe or two-way communication including sockets.

       For  connection  to a remote host via socket, GAWK_SOCK_RETRIES controls the number of retries, and GAWK_MSEC_SLEEP
       the interval between retries.  The interval is in milliseconds. On systems that do not support usleep(3), the value
       is rounded up to an integral number of seconds.

       If POSIXLY_CORRECT exists in the environment, then gawk behaves exactly as if --posix had  been  specified  on  the
       command line.  If --lint has been specified, gawk issues a warning message to this effect.

EXIT STATUS
       If the exit statement is used with a value, then gawk exits with the numeric value given to it.

       Otherwise,  if  there  were no problems during execution, gawk exits with the value of the C constant EXIT_SUCCESS.
       This is usually zero.

       If an error occurs, gawk exits with the value of the C constant EXIT_FAILURE.  This is usually one.

       If gawk exits because of a fatal error, the exit status is 2.  On non-POSIX systems, this value may  be  mapped  to
       EXIT_FAILURE.

VERSION INFORMATION
       This man page documents gawk, version 5.2.

AUTHORS
       The  original version of UNIX awk was designed and implemented by Alfred Aho, Peter Weinberger, and Brian Kernighan
       of Bell Laboratories.  Brian Kernighan continues to maintain and enhance it.

       Paul Rubin and Jay Fenlason, of the Free Software Foundation, wrote gawk, to be compatible with the  original  ver‐
       sion  of  awk  distributed  in Seventh Edition UNIX.  John Woods contributed a number of bug fixes.  David Trueman,
       with contributions from Arnold Robbins, made gawk compatible with the new version of UNIX awk.  Arnold  Robbins  is
       the current maintainer.

       See GAWK: Effective AWK Programming for a full list of the contributors to gawk and its documentation.

       See  the README file in the gawk distribution for up-to-date information about maintainers and which ports are cur‐
       rently supported.

BUG REPORTS
       If you find a bug in gawk, please use the gawkbug(1) program to report it.

       Full instructions for reporting a bug are provided in https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Bugs.html.
       Please carefully read and follow the instructions given there.  This will make bug reporting  and  resolution  much
       easier for everyone involved.  Really.

BUGS
       The  -F  option  is not necessary given the command line variable assignment feature; it remains only for backwards
       compatibility.

       This manual page is too long; gawk has too many features.

NAME
       addr2line - convert addresses or symbol+offset into file names and line numbers

SYNOPSIS
       addr2line [-a|--addresses]

                 [-C|--demangle[=style]]

                 [-R|--recurse-limit]
                 [-e filename|--exe=filename]
                 [-f|--functions] [-s|--basename]
                 [-i|--inlines]
                 [-p|--pretty-print]
                 [-j|--section=name]
                 [-H|--help] [-V|--version]
                 [addr addr ...]

DESCRIPTION
       addr2line translates addresses or symbol+offset into file names and line numbers.  Given an address or
       symbol+offset in an executable or an offset in a section of a relocatable object, it uses the debugging information
       to figure out which file name and line number are associated with it.

       The executable or relocatable object to use is specified with the -e option.  The default is the file a.out.  The
       section in the relocatable object to use is specified with the -j option.

       addr2line has two modes of operation.

       In the first, hexadecimal addresses or symbol+offset are specified on the command line, and addr2line displays the
       file name and line number for each address.

       In the second, addr2line reads hexadecimal addresses or symbol+offset from standard input, and prints the file name
       and line number for each address on standard output.  In this mode, addr2line may be used in a pipe to convert
       dynamically chosen addresses.

       The format of the output is FILENAME:LINENO.  By default each input address generates one line of output.

       Two options can generate additional lines before each FILENAME:LINENO line (in that order).

       If the -a option is used then a line with the input address is displayed.

       If the -f option is used, then a line with the FUNCTIONNAME is displayed.  This is the name of the function
       containing the address.

       One option can generate additional lines after the FILENAME:LINENO line.

       If the -i option is used and the code at the given address is present there because of inlining by the compiler
       then additional lines are displayed afterwards.  One or two extra lines (if the -f option is used) are displayed
       for each inlined function.

       Alternatively if the -p option is used then each input address generates a single, long, output line containing the
       address, the function name, the file name and the line number.  If the -i option has also been used then any
       inlined functions will be displayed in the same manner, but on separate lines, and prefixed by the text (inlined
       by).

       If the file name or function name can not be determined, addr2line will print two question marks in their place.
       If the line number can not be determined, addr2line will print 0.

       When symbol+offset is used, +offset is optional, except when the symbol is ambigious with a hex number. The
       resolved symbols can be mangled or unmangled, except unmangled symbols with + are not allowed.

OPTIONS
       The long and short forms of options, shown here as alternatives, are equivalent.

       -a
       --addresses
           Display  the address before the function name, file and line number information.  The address is printed with a
           0x prefix to easily identify it.

       -b bfdname
       --target=bfdname
           Specify that the object-code format for the object files is bfdname.

       -C
       --demangle[=style]
           Decode (demangle) low-level symbol names into  user-level  names.   Besides  removing  any  initial  underscore
           prepended  by  the system, this makes C++ function names readable.  Different compilers have different mangling
           styles. The optional demangling style argument can be used to choose an appropriate demangling style  for  your
           compiler.

       -e filename
       --exe=filename
           Specify the name of the executable for which addresses should be translated.  The default file is a.out.

       -f
       --functions
           Display function names as well as file and line number information.

       -s
       --basenames
           Display only the base of each file name.

       -i
       --inlines
           If  the address belongs to a function that was inlined, the source information for all enclosing scopes back to
           the first non-inlined function will also be printed.  For example, if "main" inlines  "callee1"  which  inlines
           "callee2", and address is from "callee2", the source information for "callee1" and "main" will also be printed.

       -j
       --section
           Read offsets relative to the specified section instead of absolute addresses.

       -p
       --pretty-print
           Make  the  output more human friendly: each location are printed on one line.  If option -i is specified, lines
           for all enclosing scopes are prefixed with (inlined by).

       -r
       -R
       --recurse-limit
       --no-recurse-limit
       --recursion-limit
       --no-recursion-limit
           Enables or disables a limit on the amount of recursion performed whilst demangling  strings.   Since  the  name
           mangling  formats allow for an infinite level of recursion it is possible to create strings whose decoding will
           exhaust the amount of stack space available on the host machine, triggering a memory fault.  The limit tries to
           prevent this from happening by restricting recursion to 2048 levels of nesting.

           The default is for this limit to be enabled, but disabling it may be  necessary  in  order  to  demangle  truly
           complicated  names.  Note however that if the recursion limit is disabled then stack exhaustion is possible and
           any bug reports about such an event will be rejected.

           The -r option is  a  synonym  for  the  --no-recurse-limit  option.   The  -R  option  is  a  synonym  for  the
           --recurse-limit option.

           Note this option is only effective if the -C or --demangle option has been enabled.

       @file
           Read  command-line options from file.  The options read are inserted in place of the original @file option.  If
           file does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated literally, and not removed.

           Options in file are separated by  whitespace.   A  whitespace  character  may  be  included  in  an  option  by
           surrounding  the entire option in either single or double quotes.  Any character (including a backslash) may be
           included by prefixing the character to be included with a backslash.  The file may  itself  contain  additional
           @file options; any such options will be processed recursively.

AMIXER(1)                                         General Commands Manual                                        AMIXER(1)

NAME
       amixer - command-line mixer for ALSA soundcard driver

SYNOPSIS
       amixer [-option] [cmd]

DESCRIPTION
       amixer  allows  command-line  control  of the mixer for the ALSA soundcard driver.  amixer supports multiple sound‐
       cards.

       amixer with no arguments will display the current mixer settings for the default soundcard and device.  This  is  a
       good way to see a list of the simple mixer controls you can use.

COMMANDS
       help   Shows syntax.

       info   Shows the information about a mixer device.

       scontrols
              Shows a complete list of simple mixer controls.

       scontents
              Shows a complete list of simple mixer controls with their contents.

       set or sset <SCONTROL> <PARAMETER> ...
              Sets  the  simple  mixer control contents. The parameter can be the volume either as a percentage from 0% to
              100% with % suffix, a dB gain with dB suffix (like -12.5dB), or an exact hardware value.  The dB gain can be
              used only for the mixer elements with available dB information.  When plus(+) or minus(-) letter is appended
              after volume value, the volume is incremented or decremented from the current value, respectively.

              The parameters cap, nocap, mute, unmute, toggle are used to change capture (recording) and  muting  for  the
              group specified.

              The  optional  modifiers  can be put as extra parameters before the value to specify the stream direction or
              channels to apply.  The modifiers playback  and  capture  specify  the  stream,  and  the  modifiers  front,
              frontleft,  frontright,  frontcenter, center, rear, rearright, rearleft, woofer are used to specify channels
              to be changed.

              A simple mixer control must be specified. Only one device can be controlled at a time.

       get or sget <SCONTROL>
              Shows the simple mixer control contents.

              A simple mixer control must be specified. Only one device can be controlled at a time.

       controls
              Shows a complete list of card controls.

       contents
              Shows a complete list of card controls with their contents.

       cset <CONTROL> <PARAMETER> ...
              Sets the card control contents. The identifier has these components: iface, name, index, device,  subdevice,
              numid. The next argument specifies the value of control.

       cget <CONTROL>
              Shows the card control contents. The identifier has same syntax as for the cset command.

ADVANCED COMMANDS
       sevents
              Shows the events for the simple mixer controls.

       events Shows the events for the mixer controls.

OPTIONS
       -c card

              Select  the card number to control. The device name created from this parameter has syntax 'hw:N' where N is
              specified card number.

       -D device

              Select the device name to control. The default control name is 'default'.

       -s | --stdin

              Read from stdin and execute the command on each line sequentially.  When this option is given,  the  command
              in command-line arguments is ignored.

              Only  sset  and  cset  are accepted.  Other commands are ignored.  The commands to unmatched ids are ignored
              without errors too.

       -h     Help: show syntax.

       -q     Quiet mode. Do not show results of changes.

       -R     Use the raw value for evaluating the percentage representation.  This is the default mode.

       -M     Use the mapped volume for evaluating the percentage representation like alsamixer, to be  more  natural  for
              human ear.

EXAMPLES
       amixer -c 1 sset Line,0 80%,40% unmute cap
              will  set  the  second soundcard's left line input volume to 80% and right line input to 40%, unmute it, and
              select it as a source for capture (recording).

       amixer -c 1 -- sset Master playback -20dB
              will set the master volume of the second card to -20dB.  If the master has multiple channels,  all  channels
              are set to the same value.

       amixer -c 1 set PCM 2dB+
              will  increase  the  PCM  volume of the second card with 2dB.  When both playback and capture volumes exist,
              this is applied to both volumes.

       amixer -c 2 cset iface=MIXER,name='Line Playback Volume",index=1 40%
              will set the third soundcard's second line playback volume(s) to 40%

       amixer -c 2 cset numid=34 40%
              will set the 34th soundcard element to 40%

add-apt-repository(1)                             General Commands Manual                            add-apt-repository(1)

NAME
       add-apt-repository  - Adds a repository into the /etc/apt/sources.list or /etc/apt/sources.list.d or removes an ex‐
       isting one

SYNOPSIS
       add-apt-repository [OPTIONS] [LINE]

DESCRIPTION
       add-apt-repository is a script which adds an external APT repository to either /etc/apt/sources.list or a  file  in
       /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ or removes an already existing repository.

OPTIONS
       Note  that  the  --list, --ppa, --cloud, --uri, --sourceslist, and LINE parameters are mutually exclusive; only one
       (or none) of them may be specified.

       -h, --help
              Show help message and exit.

       -d, --debug
              Print debug information to the command line.

       -r, --remove
              Remove the specified repository.

              This first  will  disable  (comment  out)  the  matching  line(s),  and  then  any  modified  file(s)  under
              sources.list.d/ will be removed if they contain only empty and commented lines.

              Note that this performs differently when used with the --enable-source and/or --component parameters.  With‐
              out  either  of  those parameters, this removes the specified repository, including any deb-src line(s), and
              all components.  If --enable-source is used, this disables only the 'deb-src' line(s).   If  --component  is
              used, this removes only the specified component(s), and only removes the repository if no components remain.

              If  both  --enable-source  and --component are used with --remove, the actions are performed separately: the
              specified component(s) will be removed from both deb and deb-src lines, and deb-src lines will be disabled.

       -y, --yes
              Assume yes to all queries.

       -n, --no-update
              After adding the repository, do not update the package cache.

       -l, --login
              Login to Launchpad (this is only needed for private PPAs).

              Existing authentication token will be used or a request to interactively authorize a new one will  be  made.
              It  will  be saved in the desktop keyring (when available). To instead store authentication token in a file,
              specify one via environment variable LP_CREDENTIALS_FILE.

       -s, --enable-source
              Allow downloading of the source packages from the repository.

              This adds and enables a 'deb-src' line for the repository.

              If this parameter is used without any repository, it will enable  all  currently  existing  disabled  source
              repository (deb-src) entries that have a corresponding enabled binary repository (deb) entry.

              If  this  parameter is used twice without any repository, it will also add missing source repository entries
              for all existing binary repository (deb) entries.

       -c, --component
              Which component(s) should be used with the specified repository.

              If not specified, this will default to main.  This may be used multiple times  to  specify  multiple  compo‐
              nents.

              If  this  is  used  without any repository, it will add the component(s) to all currently existing (enabled)
              repositories, but only if listed in the main sources.list file.

       -p, --pocket
              What pocket to use.

              Defaults to none, which is equivalent to the release pocket.

              If this is used without any repository, it will add the pocket to all currently existing  repositories,  but
              only  if  listed in the main sources.list file. It will use the components currently configured with the re‐
              lease pocket, or if that is not currently configured, it will use the main and restricted components.

       --dry-run
              Show what would be done, but don't make any changes.

       -L, --list
              List currently configured repositories.

              This will only list enabled repositories; it will not show disabled repository lines.

              By default, this shows only binary (deb) repositories.  If --enable-source is also used, this will also show
              source (deb-src) repositories.

       -P, --ppa
              Add an Ubuntu Launchpad Personal Package Archive.

              Must be in the format ppa:USER/PPA, USER/PPA, or USER.

              The USER parameter should be the Launchpad team or person that owns the PPA.  The PPA  parameter  should  be
              the name of the PPA; if not provided, it defaults to 'ppa'.

              The GPG public key of the PPA will also be downloaded and added to apt's keyring.

              To  add a private PPA, you must also use the --login parameter, and of course you must also be subscribed to
              the private PPA.

       -C, --cloud
              Add an Ubuntu Cloud Archive.

              Must be in the format cloud-archive:CANAME, uca:CANAME, or CANAME.

              The CANAME parameter should be the name of the Cloud Archive.  The CANAME parameter may optionally  be  suf‐
              fixed with the pocket, as either -updates or -proposed.  If not specified, the pocket defaults to -updates.

       -U, --uri
              Add an archive, specified as a single URI.

              If the URI provided is detected to be a PPA, this will operate as if the --ppa parameter was used.

       -S, --sourceslist
              Add an archive, specified as a full source entry line in one-line sources.list format.

              This must follow the ONE-LINE-STYLE format as described in the sources.list manpage.

              If the URI provided is detected to be a PPA, this will operate as if the --ppa parameter was used.

LINE
       LINE is a deprecated method to specify the repository to add/remove, provided only for backwards compatibility.  It
       can  be  specified  in  any  of the supported formats: sources.list line, plain uri, ppa shortcut, or cloud-archive
       shortcut.  It can also be specified as one or more valid component(s).  The script will  attempt  to  detect  which
       format is provided.

       This  is  not recommended as the autodetection of which line format is intended can be ambiguous, but older scripts
       may still use this method of specifying the repository.

       One special case of LINE is providing the value -, which will then read the LINE from stdin.

       add-apt-repository -P user/repository

       add-apt-repository -C cloud-archive:queens

ARPD(8)                                           System Manager's Manual                                          ARPD(8)

NAME
       arpd - userspace arp daemon.

SYNOPSIS
       Usage: arpd [ -lkh? ] [ -a N ] [ -b dbase ] [ -B number ] [ -f file ] [-p interval ] [ -n time ] [ -R rate ] [ <IN‐
       TERFACES> ]

DESCRIPTION
       The arpd daemon collects gratuitous ARP information, saving it on local disk and feeding it to the kernel on demand
       to avoid redundant broadcasting due to limited size of the kernel ARP cache.

OPTIONS
       -h -?  Print help

       -l     Dump the arpd database to stdout and exit. The output consists of three columns: the interface index, the IP
              address  of  the  interface,  and the MAC address of the interface. Negative entries for dead hosts are also
              shown, in this case the MAC address is replaced by the word FAILED followed by a colon and the  most  recent
              time when the fact that the host is dead was proven.

       -f <FILE>
              Read  and  load  an arpd database from FILE in a text format similar to that dumped by option -l. Exit after
              load, possibly listing resulting database, if option -l is also given. If FILE is -, stdin is  read  to  get
              the ARP table.

       -b <DATABASE>
              the location of the database file. The default location is /var/lib/arpd/arpd.db

       -a <NUMBER>
              With this option, arpd not only passively listens for ARP packets on the interface, but also sends broadcast
              queries  itself.  NUMBER is the number of such queries to make before a destination is considered dead. When
              arpd is started as kernel helper (i.e. with app_solicit enabled in sysctl or even with  option  -k)  without
              this option and still did not learn enough information, you can observe 1 second gaps in service. Not fatal,
              but not good.

       -k     Suppress sending broadcast queries by the kernel. This option only makes sense together with option -a.

       -n <TIME>
              Specifies  the timeout of the negative cache. When resolution fails, arpd suppresses further attempts to re‐
              solve for this period. This option only makes sense together with option '-k'. This timeout  should  not  be
              too much longer than the boot time of a typical host not supporting gratuitous ARP. Default value is 60 sec‐
              onds.

       -p <TIME>
              The  time  to wait in seconds between polling attempts to the kernel ARP table. TIME may be a floating point
              number. The default value is 30.

       -R <RATE>
              Maximal steady rate of broadcasts sent by arpd in packets per second. Default value is 1.

       -B <NUMBER>
              The number of broadcasts sent by arpd back to back. Default value is 3. Together with the  -R  option,  this
              option  ensures that the number of ARP queries that are broadcast does not exceed B+R*T over any interval of
              time T.

       <INTERFACES> is a list of names of networking interfaces to watch. If no interfaces are given,  arpd  monitors  all
       the  interfaces. In this case arpd does not adjust sysctl parameters, it is assumed that the user does this himself
       after arpd is started.

SIGNALS
       When arpd receives a SIGINT or SIGTERM signal, it exits gracefully, syncing the database and restoring adjusted
       sysctl parameters. On a SIGHUP it syncs the database to disk. With SIGUSR1 it sends some statistics to syslog. The
       effect of any other signals is undefined. In particular, they may corrupt the database and leave the sysctl parame‐
       ters in an unpredictable state.

NOTE
       In order for arpd to be able to serve as ARP resolver, the kernel must be compiled with the option CONFIG_ARPD and,
       in the case when interface list in not given on command line, variable app_solicit on interfaces of interest should
       be in /proc/sys/net/ipv4/neigh/*. If this is not made arpd still collects gratuitous ARP information in its data‐
       base.

EXAMPLES
       arpd -b /var/tmp/arpd.db
              Start arpd to collect gratuitous ARP, but not messing with kernel functionality.

       killall arpd ; arpd -l -b /var/tmp/arpd.db
              Look at result after some time.

       arpd -b /var/tmp/arpd.db -a 1 eth0 eth1
              Enable kernel helper, leaving leading role to kernel.

       arpd -b /var/tmp/arpd.db -a 3 -k eth0 eth1
              Completely replace kernel resolution on interfaces eth0 and eth1. In this case the kernel still does unicast
              probing to validate entries, but all the broadcast activity is suppressed and made under authority of arpd.

       This is the mode in which arpd normally is supposed to work. It is not the default to prevent  occasional  enabling
       of too aggressive a mode.

                                                       28 June, 2007                                               ARPD(8)

AXFER(1)                                          General Commands Manual                                         AXFER(1)

NAME
       axfer  - command-line sound recorder and player for sound devices and nodes supported by Linux sound subsystem (Ad‐
       vanced Linux Sound Architecture, also known as ALSA).

SYNOPSYS
       axfer subcommand direction options

       subcommand = transfer | list | version | help

       direction = capture | playback

       options = ( depends on subcommand )

DESCRIPTION
       The axfer is a command-line recorder and player to transfer  audio  data  frame  between  sound  devices/nodes  and
       files/stdin/stdout.

OPTIONS
   Subcommand
       transfer
              Performs transmission of audio data frame. Its detail is described in axfer-transfer(1) manual.

       list   Dumps lists of available sound devices and nodes. Its detail is described in axfer-list(1) manual.

       version
              Prints version of this application (as the same version as alsa-utils package).

       help   Prints a short message about subcommands for users to enter this application.

   Direction
       capture
              Operates for capture transmission.

       playback
              Operates for playback transmission.

EXIT STATUS
       EXIT_SUCCESS (0) if run time successfully finished, else EXIT_FAILURE (1).

UNIT TEST
       This program has unit tests for internal implementation. Please refer to the manual of axfer-transfer for details.

COMPATIBILITY TO APLAY
       The  axfer  is  designed  to  be  compatible  to  aplay(1)  as  much  as  possible.  In command line, executions of
       aplay/arecord files under $PATH runs axfer with compatibility  mode  if  filesystem  has  symbolic  link  from  the
       aplay/arecord to axfer.

           $ ln -s aplay axfer
           $ ln -s arecord axfer

   A string to which arg[0] points
       When  args[0]  in run time points to string ended with 'aplay', it has the same meaning of playback direction. When
       it points to string ended with 'arecord', it has the same meaning of capture direction.

   Options acknowledged as list subcommand
       Options of -l , --list-devices , -L , --list-pcms are acknowledged as list subcommand. Without them, the  run  time

ADD-SHELL(8)                                      System Manager's Manual                                     ADD-SHELL(8)

NAME
       add-shell - add shells to the list of valid login shells

SYNOPSIS
       add-shell shellname [shellname...]

DESCRIPTION
       add-shell  copies  /etc/shells  to  /etc/shells.tmp,  adds  the  given  shells to this file if they are not already
       present, and copies this temporary file back to /etc/shells.

       The shells must be provided by their full pathnames.

ENVIRONMENT
       DPKG_ROOT
              specifies the base path under which /etc/shells resides.

ANACRON(8)                                         Anacron Users' Manual                                        ANACRON(8)

NAME
       anacron - runs commands periodically

SYNOPSIS
       anacron [-s] [-f] [-n] [-d] [-q] [-t anacrontab] [-S spooldir] [job] ...
       anacron [-S spooldir] -u [-t anacrontab] [job] ...
       anacron [-V|-h]
       anacron -T [-t anacrontab]

DESCRIPTION
       Anacron  can  be used to execute commands periodically, with a frequency specified in days. Unlike cron(8), it does
       not assume that the machine is running continuously. Hence, it can be used on machines that aren't running 24 hours
       a day, to control daily, weekly, and monthly jobs that are usually controlled by cron.

       When  executed,  Anacron  reads  a  list  of  jobs  from  a  configuration  file,  normally  /etc/anacrontab   (see
       anacrontab(5)).  This  file  contains  the list of jobs that Anacron controls. Each job entry specifies a period in
       days, a delay in minutes, a unique job identifier, and a shell command.

       For each job, Anacron checks whether this job has been executed in the last n days, where n is the period specified
       for that job. If not, Anacron runs the job's shell command, after waiting for the number of  minutes  specified  as
       the delay parameter.

       After  the command exits, Anacron records the date in a special timestamp file for that job, so it can know when to
       execute it again. Only the date is used for the time calculations. The hour is not used.

       When there are no more jobs to be run, Anacron exits.

       Anacron only considers jobs whose identifier, as specified in the anacrontab matches any of  the  job  command-line
       arguments.  The job arguments can be shell wildcard patterns (be sure to protect them from your shell with adequate
       quoting). Specifying no job arguments, is equivalent to specifying "*". (That is, all jobs will be considered).

       Unless the -d option is given (see below), Anacron forks to the background when it starts, and the  parent  process
       exits immediately.

       Unless  the  -s or -n options are given, Anacron starts jobs immediately when their delay is over. The execution of
       different jobs is completely independent.

       If a job generates any output on its standard output or standard error, the output is mailed to  the  user  running
       Anacron (usually root), or to the address contained by the MAILTO environment variable in the /etc/anacrontab file,
       if such exists.

       Informative messages about what Anacron is doing are sent to syslogd(8) under facility cron, priority notice. Error
       messages are sent at priority error.

       "Active"  jobs  (i.e.  jobs that Anacron already decided to run and now wait for their delay to pass, and jobs that
       are currently being executed by Anacron), are "locked", so that other copies of Anacron won't run them at the  same
       time.

OPTIONS
       -f     Force execution of the jobs, ignoring the timestamps.

       -u     Only update the timestamps of the jobs, to the current date, but don't run anything.

       -s     Serialize execution of jobs. Anacron will not start a new job before the previous one finished.

       -n     Run jobs now. Ignore the delay specifications in the /etc/anacrontab file. This options implies -s.

       -d     Don't fork to the background. In this mode, Anacron will output informational messages to standard error, as
              well as to syslog. The output of jobs is mailed as usual.

       -q     Suppress messages to standard error. Only applicable with -d.

       -t anacrontab
              Use specified anacrontab, rather than the default.

       -T     Anacrontab testing. The configuration file will be tested for validity. If there is an error in the file, an
              error will be shown and anacron will return 1. Valid anacrontabs will return 0.

       -S spooldir
              Use the specified spooldir to store timestamps in. This option is required for users who wish to run anacron
              themselves.

       -V     Print version information, and exit.

       -h     Print short usage message, and exit.

SIGNALS
       After  receiving  a  SIGUSR1  signal, Anacron waits for running jobs, if any, to finish and then exits. This can be
       used to stop Anacron cleanly.

NOTES
       Make sure that the time-zone is set correctly before Anacron is started. (The time-zone affects the date). This  is
       usually  accomplished  by setting the TZ environment variable, or by installing a /usr/lib/zoneinfo/localtime file.
       See tzset(3) for more information.

       Timestamp files are created in the spool directory for each job in anacrontab. These are  never  removed  automati‐
       cally by anacron, and should be removed by hand if a job is no longer being scheduled.

DEBIAN-SPECIFIC CONFIGURATION
       On  Debian-based  systems,  anacron  will  be  activated hourly every day from 07:30 local time to 23:30 local time
       through cron job (on non-systemd systems where cron is installed and enabled) or systemd  timer  (on  systemd-based
       systems).  On activation, anacron will check if it missed some jobs. If yes, it will start those jobs after a short
       period of time.

       By default, the hourly activation of anacron will not take place when the system is using battery and no  AC  power
       is connected to the computer. It is meant to reduce power usage and extend battery life, but such design might lead
       to unwanted results. Users may disable this feature and let anacron run regardless of power supply.

       Please  read Debian-specific documentation in /usr/share/doc/anacron/README.Debian file for detailed instruction in
       how to change such behaviour.

FILES
       /etc/anacrontab
              Contains specifications of jobs.  See anacrontab(5) for a complete description.

       /var/spool/anacron
              This directory is used by Anacron for storing timestamp files.

       /lib/systemd/system/anacron.service
              This file provides systemd service for anacron.

       /lib/systemd/system/anacron.timer
              This file provides systemd timer for anacron.  Currently the service is  triggered  hourly  through  systemd
              timer.

BUGS
       Anacron never removes timestamp files. Remove unused files manually.

       Anacron  uses  up to two file descriptors for each active job. It may run out of descriptors if there are more than
       about 125 active jobs (on normal kernels).

NAME
       apt-cache - query the APT cache

SYNOPSIS

       apt-cache [-agipns] [-o=config_string] [-c=config_file] {gencaches | showpkg pkg...  | showsrc pkg...  | stats |
                 dump | dumpavail | unmet | search regex...  | show pkg [{=pkg_version_number | /target_release}]...  |
                 depends pkg [{=pkg_version_number | /target_release}]...  |
                 rdepends pkg [{=pkg_version_number | /target_release}]...  | pkgnames [prefix]  |
                 dotty pkg [{=pkg_version_number | /target_release}]...  |
                 xvcg pkg [{=pkg_version_number | /target_release}]...  | policy [pkg...]  | madison pkg...  |
                 {-v | --version} | {-h | --help}}

DESCRIPTION
       apt-cache performs a variety of operations on APT's package cache.  apt-cache does not manipulate the state of the
       system but does provide operations to search and generate interesting output from the package metadata. The
       metadata is acquired and updated via the 'update' command of e.g.  apt-get, so that it can be outdated if the last
       update is too long ago, but in exchange apt-cache works independently of the availability of the configured sources
       (e.g. offline).

       Unless the -h, or --help option is given, one of the commands below must be present.

       gencaches
           gencaches creates APT's package cache. This is done implicitly by all commands needing this cache if it is
           missing or outdated.

       showpkg pkg...
           showpkg displays information about the packages listed on the command line. Remaining arguments are package
           names. The available versions and reverse dependencies of each package listed are listed, as well as forward
           dependencies for each version. Forward (normal) dependencies are those packages upon which the package in
           question depends; reverse dependencies are those packages that depend upon the package in question. Thus,
           forward dependencies must be satisfied for a package, but reverse dependencies need not be. For instance,
           apt-cache showpkg libreadline2 would produce output similar to the following:

               Package: libreadline2
               Versions: 2.1-12(/var/state/apt/lists/foo_Packages),
               Reverse Depends:
                 libreadlineg2,libreadline2
                 libreadline2-altdev,libreadline2
               Dependencies:
               2.1-12 - libc5 (2 5.4.0-0) ncurses3.0 (0 (null))
               Provides:
               2.1-12 -
               Reverse Provides:
           Thus it may be seen that libreadline2, version 2.1-12, depends on libc5 and ncurses3.0 which must be installed
           for libreadline2 to work. In turn, libreadlineg2 and libreadline2-altdev depend on libreadline2. If
           libreadline2 is installed, libc5 and ncurses3.0 (and ldso) must also be installed; libreadlineg2 and
           libreadline2-altdev do not have to be installed. For the specific meaning of the remainder of the output it is
           best to consult the apt source code.

       stats
           stats displays some statistics about the cache. No further arguments are expected. Statistics reported are:

           •   Total package names is the number of package names found in the cache.

           •   Normal packages is the number of regular, ordinary package names; these are packages that bear a one-to-one
               correspondence between their names and the names used by other packages for them in dependencies. The
               majority of packages fall into this category.

           •   Pure virtual packages is the number of packages that exist only as a virtual package name; that is,
               packages only "provide" the virtual package name, and no package actually uses the name. For instance,
               "mail-transport-agent" in the Debian system is a pure virtual package; several packages provide
               "mail-transport-agent", but there is no package named "mail-transport-agent".

           •   Single virtual packages is the number of packages with only one package providing a particular virtual
               package. For example, in the Debian system, "X11-text-viewer" is a virtual package, but only one package,
               xless, provides "X11-text-viewer".

           •   Mixed virtual packages is the number of packages that either provide a particular virtual package or have
               the virtual package name as the package name. For instance, in the Debian system, "debconf" is both an
               actual package, and provided by the debconf-tiny package.

           •   Missing is the number of package names that were referenced in a dependency but were not provided by any
               package. Missing packages may be an evidence if a full distribution is not accessed, or if a package (real
               or virtual) has been dropped from the distribution. Usually they are referenced from Conflicts or Breaks
               statements.

           •   Total distinct versions is the number of package versions found in the cache. If more than one distribution
               is being accessed (for instance, "stable" and "unstable"), this value can be considerably larger than the
               number of total package names.

           •   Total dependencies is the number of dependency relationships claimed by all of the packages in the cache.

       showsrc pkg...
           showsrc displays all the source package records that match the given package names. All versions are shown, as
           well as all records that declare the name to be a binary package. Use --only-source to display only source
           package names.

       dump
           dump shows a short listing of every package in the cache. It is primarily for debugging.

       dumpavail
           dumpavail prints out an available list to stdout. This is suitable for use with dpkg(1) and is used by the
           dselect(1) method.

       unmet
           unmet displays a summary of all unmet dependencies in the package cache.

       show pkg...
           show performs a function similar to dpkg --print-avail; it displays the package records for the named packages.

       search regex...
           search performs a full text search on all available package lists for the POSIX regex pattern given, see
           regex(7). It searches the package names and the descriptions for an occurrence of the regular expression and
           prints out the package name and the short description, including virtual package names. If --full is given then
           output identical to show is produced for each matched package, and if --names-only is given then the long
           description is not searched, only the package name and provided packages are.

           Separate arguments can be used to specify multiple search patterns that are and'ed together.

       depends pkg...
           depends shows a listing of each dependency a package has and all the possible other packages that can fulfill
           that dependency.

       rdepends pkg...
           rdepends shows a listing of each reverse dependency a package has.

       pkgnames [prefix]
           This command prints the name of each package APT knows. The optional argument is a prefix match to filter the
           name list. The output is suitable for use in a shell tab complete function and the output is generated
           extremely quickly. This command is best used with the --generate option.

           Note that a package which APT knows of is not necessarily available to download, installable or installed, e.g.
           virtual packages are also listed in the generated list.

       dotty pkg...
           dotty takes a list of packages on the command line and generates output suitable for use by dotty from the
           GraphViz[1] package. The result will be a set of nodes and edges representing the relationships between the
           packages. By default the given packages will trace out all dependent packages; this can produce a very large
           graph. To limit the output to only the packages listed on the command line, set the APT::Cache::GivenOnly
           option.

           The resulting nodes will have several shapes; normal packages are boxes, pure virtual packages are triangles,
           mixed virtual packages are diamonds, missing packages are hexagons. Orange boxes mean recursion was stopped
           (leaf packages), blue lines are pre-depends, green lines are conflicts.

           Caution, dotty cannot graph larger sets of packages.

       xvcg pkg...
           The same as dotty, only for xvcg from the VCG tool[2].

       policy [pkg...]
           policy is meant to help debug issues relating to the preferences file. With no arguments it will print out the
           priorities of each source. Otherwise it prints out detailed information about the priority selection of the
           named package.

       madison pkg...
           apt-cache's madison command attempts to mimic the output format and a subset of the functionality of the Debian
           archive management tool, madison. It displays available versions of a package in a tabular format. Unlike the
           original madison, it can only display information for the architecture for which APT has retrieved package
           lists (APT::Architecture).

OPTIONS
       All command line options may be set using the configuration file, the descriptions indicate the configuration
       option to set. For boolean options you can override the config file by using something like -f-,--no-f, -f=no or
       several other variations.

       -p, --pkg-cache
           Select the file to store the package cache. The package cache is the primary cache used by all operations.
           Configuration Item: Dir::Cache::pkgcache.

       -s, --src-cache
           Select the file to store the source cache. The source is used only by gencaches and it stores a parsed version
           of the package information from remote sources. When building the package cache the source cache is used to
           avoid reparsing all of the package files. Configuration Item: Dir::Cache::srcpkgcache.

       -q, --quiet
           Quiet; produces output suitable for logging, omitting progress indicators. More q's will produce more quietness
           up to a maximum of 2. You can also use -q=# to set the quietness level, overriding the configuration file.
           Configuration Item: quiet.

       -i, --important
           Print only important dependencies; for use with unmet and depends. Causes only Depends and Pre-Depends
           relations to be printed. Configuration Item: APT::Cache::Important.

       --no-pre-depends, --no-depends, --no-recommends, --no-suggests, --no-conflicts, --no-breaks, --no-replaces,
       --no-enhances
           Per default the depends and rdepends print all dependencies. This can be tweaked with these flags which will
           omit the specified dependency type. Configuration Item: APT::Cache::ShowDependencyType e.g.
           APT::Cache::ShowRecommends.

       --implicit
           Per default depends and rdepends print only dependencies explicitly expressed in the metadata. With this flag
           it will also show dependencies implicitly added based on the encountered data. A Conflicts: foo e.g. expresses
           implicitly that this package also conflicts with the package foo from any other architecture. Configuration
           Item: APT::Cache::ShowImplicit.

       -f, --full
           Print full package records when searching. Configuration Item: APT::Cache::ShowFull.

       -a, --all-versions
           Print full records for all available versions. This is the default; to turn it off, use --no-all-versions. If
           --no-all-versions is specified, only the candidate version will be displayed (the one which would be selected
           for installation). This option is only applicable to the show command. Configuration Item:
           APT::Cache::AllVersions.

       -g, --generate
           Perform automatic package cache regeneration, rather than use the cache as it is. This is the default; to turn
           it off, use --no-generate. Configuration Item: APT::Cache::Generate.

       --names-only, -n
           Only search on the package and provided package names, not the long descriptions. Configuration Item:
           APT::Cache::NamesOnly.

       --all-names
           Make pkgnames print all names, including virtual packages and missing dependencies. Configuration Item:
           APT::Cache::AllNames.

       --recurse
           Make depends and rdepends recursive so that all packages mentioned are printed once. Configuration Item:
           APT::Cache::RecurseDepends.

       --installed
           Limit the output of depends and rdepends to packages which are currently installed. Configuration Item:
           APT::Cache::Installed.

       --with-source filename
           Adds the given file as a source for metadata. Can be repeated to add multiple files. Supported are currently
           *.deb, *.dsc, *.changes, Sources and Packages files as well as source package directories. Files are matched
           based on their name only, not their content!

           Sources and Packages can be compressed in any format apt supports as long as they have the correct extension.
           If you need to store multiple of these files in one directory you can prefix a name of your choice with the
           last character being an underscore ("_"). Example: my.example_Packages.xz

NAME
       arptables - ARP table administration (nft-based)

SYNOPSIS
       arptables [-t table] -[AD] chain rule-specification [options]
       arptables [-t table] -[RI] chain rulenum rule-specification [options]
       arptables [-t table] -D chain rulenum [options]
       arptables [-t table] -[LFZ] [chain] [options]
       arptables [-t table] -[NX] chain
       arptables [-t table] -E old-chain-name new-chain-name
       arptables [-t table] -P chain target [options]

DESCRIPTION
       arptables  is  a  user  space  tool, it is used to set up and maintain the tables of ARP rules in the Linux kernel.
       These rules inspect the ARP frames which they see.  arptables is analogous to the iptables  user  space  tool,  but
       arptables is less complicated.

   CHAINS
       The kernel table is used to divide functionality into different sets of rules. Each set of rules is called a chain.
       Each chain is an ordered list of rules that can match ARP frames. If a rule matches an ARP frame, then a processing
       specification  tells  what  to do with that matching frame. The processing specification is called a 'target'. How‐
       ever, if the frame does not match the current rule in the chain, then the next rule in the chain is examined and so
       forth.  The user can create new (user-defined) chains which can be used as the 'target' of a rule.

   TARGETS
       A firewall rule specifies criteria for an ARP frame and a frame processing specification called a target.   When  a
       frame  matches  a rule, then the next action performed by the kernel is specified by the target.  The target can be
       one of these values: ACCEPT, DROP, CONTINUE, RETURN, an 'extension' (see below) or a user-defined chain.

       ACCEPT means to let the frame through.  DROP means the frame has to be dropped.  CONTINUE means the next  rule  has
       to  be checked. This can be handy to know how many frames pass a certain point in the chain or to log those frames.
       RETURN means stop traversing this chain and resume at the next rule in the previous (calling) chain.  For  the  ex‐
       tension targets please see the TARGET EXTENSIONS section of this man page.

   TABLES
       There  is  only  one ARP table in the Linux kernel.  The table is filter.  You can drop the '-t filter' argument to
       the arptables command.  The -t argument must be the first argument on the arptables command line, if used.

       -t, --table
              filter, is the only table and contains two built-in chains: INPUT (for frames destined  for  the  host)  and
              OUTPUT (for locally-generated frames).

ARPTABLES COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
       After  the  initial  arptables command line argument, the remaining arguments can be divided into several different
       groups.  These groups are commands, miscellaneous commands, rule-specifications, match-extensions, and  watcher-ex‐
       tensions.

   COMMANDS
       The  arptables  command arguments specify the actions to perform on the table defined with the -t argument.  If you
       do not use the -t argument to name a table, the commands apply to the default filter table.  With the exception  of
       the -Z command, only one command may be used on the command line at a time.

       -A, --append
              Append a rule to the end of the selected chain.

       -D, --delete
              Delete  the  specified rule from the selected chain. There are two ways to use this command. The first is by
              specifying an interval of rule numbers to delete, syntax: start_nr[:end_nr]. Using negative numbers  is  al‐
              lowed,  for more details about using negative numbers, see the -I command. The second usage is by specifying
              the complete rule as it would have been specified when it was added.

       -I, --insert
              Insert the specified rule into the selected chain at the specified rule number.  If the  current  number  of
              rules  equals N, then the specified number can be between -N and N+1. For a positive number i, it holds that
              i and i-N-1 specify the same place in the chain where the rule should be inserted. The  number  0  specifies
              the  place  past  the last rule in the chain and using this number is therefore equivalent with using the -A
              command.

       -R, --replace
              Replaces the specified rule into the selected chain at the specified rule number.  If the current number  of
              rules  equals  N, then the specified number can be between 1 and N. i specifies the place in the chain where
              the rule should be replaced.

       -P, --policy
              Set the policy for the chain to the given target. The policy can be ACCEPT, DROP or RETURN.

       -F, --flush
              Flush the selected chain. If no chain is selected, then every chain will be flushed. Flushing the chain does
              not change the policy of the chain, however.

       -Z, --zero
              Set the counters of the selected chain to zero. If no chain is selected, all the counters are set  to  zero.
              The  -Z  command  can be used in conjunction with the -L command.  When both the -Z and -L commands are used
              together in this way, the rule counters are printed on the screen before they are set to zero.

       -L, --list
              List all rules in the selected chain. If no chain is selected, all chains are listed.

       -N, --new-chain
              Create a new user-defined chain with the given name. The number of user-defined chains is unlimited. A user-
              defined chain name has maximum length of 31 characters.

       -X, --delete-chain
              Delete the specified user-defined chain. There must be no remaining references to the specified chain,  oth‐
              erwise  arptables  will  refuse  to delete it. If no chain is specified, all user-defined chains that aren't
              referenced will be removed.

       -E, --rename-chain
              Rename the specified chain to a new name.  Besides renaming a user-defined chain, you may rename a  standard
              chain  name to a name that suits your taste. For example, if you like PREBRIDGING more than PREROUTING, then
              you can use the -E command to rename the PREROUTING chain. If you do rename one of  the  standard  arptables
              chain  names, please be sure to mention this fact should you post a question on the arptables mailing lists.
              It would be wise to use the standard name in your post. Renaming a standard arptables chain in this  fashion
              has no effect on the structure or function of the arptables kernel table.

   MISCELLANEOUS COMMANDS
       -V, --version
              Show the version of the arptables userspace program.

       -h, --help
              Give a brief description of the command syntax.

       -j, --jump target
              The target of the rule. This is one of the following values: ACCEPT, DROP, CONTINUE, RETURN, a target exten‐
              sion (see TARGET EXTENSIONS) or a user-defined chain name.

       -c, --set-counters PKTS BYTES
              This  enables the administrator to initialize the packet and byte counters of a rule (during INSERT, APPEND,
              REPLACE operations).

   RULE-SPECIFICATIONS
       The following command line arguments make up a rule specification (as used in the add and delete commands).  A  "!"
       option  before the specification inverts the test for that specification. Apart from these standard rule specifica‐
       tions there are some other command line arguments of interest.

       -s, --source-ip [!] address[/mask]
              The Source IP specification.

       -d, --destination-ip [!] address[/mask]
              The Destination IP specification.

       --source-mac [!] address[/mask]
              The source mac address. Both mask and address are written as 6 hexadecimal numbers separated by colons.

       --destination-mac [!] address[/mask]
              The destination mac address. Both mask and address are written as 6 hexadecimal numbers separated by colons.

       -i, --in-interface [!] name
              The interface via which a frame is received (for the INPUT chain). The flag --in-if is an alias for this op‐
              tion.

       -o, --out-interface [!] name
              The interface via which a frame is going to be sent (for the OUTPUT chain). The flag --out-if  is  an  alias
              for this option.

       -l, --h-length length[/mask]
              The hardware length (nr of bytes)

       --opcode code[/mask]
              The  operation  code  (2  bytes).  Available values are: 1=Request 2=Reply 3=Request_Reverse 4=Reply_Reverse
              5=DRARP_Request 6=DRARP_Reply 7=DRARP_Error 8=InARP_Request 9=ARP_NAK.

       --h-type type[/mask]
              The hardware type (2 bytes, hexadecimal). Available values are: 1=Ethernet.

       --proto-type type[/mask]
              The protocol type (2 bytes). Available values are: 0x800=IPv4.

   TARGET-EXTENSIONS
       arptables extensions are precompiled into the userspace tool. So there is no need to explicitly load them with a -m
       option like in iptables.  However, these extensions deal with functionality supported by supplemental  kernel  mod‐
       ules.

   mangle
       --mangle-ip-s IP address
              Mangles Source IP Address to given value.

       --mangle-ip-d IP address
              Mangles Destination IP Address to given value.

       --mangle-mac-s MAC address
              Mangles Source MAC Address to given value.

       --mangle-mac-d MAC address
              Mangles Destination MAC Address to given value.

       --mangle-target target
              Target of ARP mangle operation (DROP, CONTINUE or ACCEPT -- default is ACCEPT).

   CLASSIFY
       This  module  allows you to set the skb->priority value (and thus clas- sify the packet into a specific CBQ class).

       --set-class major:minor

              Set  the  major  and minor  class  value.  The  values  are  always interpreted as hexadecimal even if no 0x
              prefix is given.

   MARK
       This  module  allows you to set the skb->mark value (and thus classify the packet by the mark in u32)

       --set-mark mark
              Set the mark value. The  values  are  always interpreted as hexadecimal even if no 0x prefix is given

       --and-mark mark
              Binary AND the mark with bits.

       --or-mark mark
              Binary OR the mark with bits.

NOTES
       In this nft-based version of arptables, support for FORWARD chain has not been implemented. Since ARP  packets  are
       "forwarded" only by Linux bridges, the same may be achieved using FORWARD chain in ebtables.

DESCRIPTION
       adduser  and addgroup add users and groups to the system according to command line options and configuration infor‐
       mation in /etc/adduser.conf.  They are friendlier front ends to the low level  tools  like  useradd,  groupadd  and
       usermod  programs,  by default choosing Debian policy conformant UID and GID values, creating a home directory with
       skeletal configuration, running a custom script, and other features.

       adduser and addgroup are intended as a policy layer, making it easier for package maintainers and local administra‐
       tors to create local system accounts in the way Debian expects them to be created, taking the burden  to  adapt  to
       the  probably changing specifications of Debian policy.  adduser --system takes special attention on just needing a
       single call in the package maintainer scripts without any conditional wrappers, error suppression  or  other  scaf‐
       folding.

       adduser honors the distinction between dynamically allocated system users and groups and dynamically allocated user
       accounts that is documented in Debian Policy, Chapter 9.2.2.

       For a full list and explanations of all options, see the OPTIONS section.

       adduser and addgroup can be run in one of five modes:

   Add a normal user
       If  called  with  one  non-option  argument and without the --system or --group  options, adduser will add a normal
       user, that means a dynamically allocated user account in the sense of Debian Policy.  This is commonly referred  to
       in adduser as a non-system user.

       adduser will choose the first available UID from the range specified by FIRST_UID and LAST_UID in the configuration
       file.   The  range  may be overridden with the --firstuid and --lastuid options.  Finally, the UID can be set fully
       manually with the --uid option.

       By default, each user is given a corresponding group with the same name.  This is commonly  called  Usergroups  and
       allows  group  writable directories to be easily maintained by placing the appropriate users in the new group, set‐
       ting the set-group-ID bit in the directory, and ensuring that all users use a umask of 002.

       For a usergroup, adduser will choose the first available GID from the range specified by FIRST_GID and LAST_GID  in
       the  configuration  file.  The range may be overridden with the --firstgid and --lastgid options.  Finally, the GID
       can be set fully manually with the --gid option.

       The interaction between USERS_GID, USERS_GROUP, and USERGROUPS is explained in detail in adduser.conf(5).

       Users' primary groups can also be overridden from the command line with the --gid  or --ingroup options to set  the
       group  by  id  or  name,  respectively.  Also, users can be added to one or more supplemental groups defined as EX‐
       TRA_GROUPS in the configuration file either by setting ADD_EXTRA_GROUPS to 1 in the configuration file, or by pass‐
       ing --add-extra-groups on the command line.

       adduser will copy files from /etc/skel into the home directory and prompt for the comment field and a  password  if
       those functions have not been turned off / overridden from the command line.

       UID, comment, home directory and shell might be pre-determined with the UID_POOL and GID_POOL option, documented in
       adduser.conf(5).

       To set up an encrypted home directory for the new user, add the --encrypt-home option.  For more information, refer
       to the -b option of ecryptfs-setup-private(1).

   Add a system user
       If  called  with  one  non-option argument and the --system option, adduser will add a dynamically allocated system
       user, often abbreviated as system user in the context of the adduser package.

       adduser will choose the first available UID from the range specified by FIRST_SYSTEM_UID and LAST_SYSTEM_UID in the
       configuration file.  This can be overridden with the --uid option.

       By default, system users are placed in the nogroup group.  To place the new system  user  in  an  already  existing
       group,  use  the  --gid or --ingroup options.  If the --group is given and the identically named group does not al‐
       ready exist, it is created with the same ID.

       If no home directory is specified, the default home directory for a new system user is /nonexistent.   This  direc‐
       tory should never exist on any Debian system, and adduser will never create it automatically.

       Unless  a  shell  is  explicitly  set  with  the  --shell  option,  the  new system user will have the shell set to
       /usr/sbin/nologin.  adduser --system does not set a password for the new account.  Skeletal configuration files are
       not copied.

       Other options will behave as for the creation of a normal user.  The files referenced by UID_POOL and  GID_POOL  do
       also work.

   Add a group
       If adduser is called with the --group option and without the --system option, or addgroup is called respectively, a
       user group will be added.

       A dynamically allocated system group, often abbreviated as system group in the context of the adduser package, will
       be created if adduser is called with the --system option.

       A  GID  will be chosen from the respective range specified for GIDs in the configuration file (FIRST_GID, LAST_GID,
       FIRST_SYSTEM_GID, LAST_SYSTEM_GID).  To override that mechanism, you can give the GID using the --gid option.

       For non-system groups, the range specified in the configuration file may be  overridden  with  the  --firstgid  and
       --lastgid options.

       The group is created with no members.

   Add an existing user to an existing group
       If called with two non-option arguments, adduser will add an existing user to an existing group.

OPTIONS
       Different  modes  of adduser allow different options.  If no valid modes are listed for a option, it is accepted in
       all modes.

       Short versions for certain options may exist for historical reasons.  They are going to stay supported, but are re‐
       moved from the documentation.  Users are advised to migrate to the long version of options.

       --add-extra-groups
              Add new user to extra groups defined in the configuration files' EXTRA_GROUPS  setting.   The  old  spelling
              --add_extra_groups  is  deprecated and will be supported in Debian bookworm only.  Valid Modes: adduser, ad‐
              duser --system.

       --allow-all-names
              Allow any user- and groupname which is supported by the underlying useradd(8),  including  names  containing
              non-ASCII  characters.   See  VALID  NAMES  in adduser.conf(5).  Valid Modes: adduser, adduser --system, ad‐
              dgroup, addgroup --system.

       --allow-bad-names
              Disable NAME_REGEX and SYS_NAME_REGEX check of names.  Only a weaker check for validity of the name  is  ap‐
              plied.   See  VALID  NAMES  in  adduser.conf(5).  Valid Modes: adduser, adduser --system, addgroup, addgroup
              --system.

       --comment comment
              Set the comment field for the new entry generated.  adduser will not ask for the information if this  option
              is  given.  This field is also known under the name GECOS field and contains information that is used by the
              finger(1) command.  This used to be the --gecos option, which is deprecated and will be removed after Debian
              bookworm.  Valid Modes: adduser, adduser --system.

       --conf file
              Use file instead of /etc/adduser.conf.  Multiple --conf options can be given.

       --debug
              Synonymous to --stdoutmsglevel=debug. Deprecated.

       --disabled-login
       --disabled-password
              Do not run passwd(1) to set a password.  In most situations, logins are still possible though  (for  example
              using SSH keys or through PAM) for reasons that are beyond adduser's scope.  --disabled-login will addition‐
              ally set the shell to /usr/sbin/nologin.  Valid Mode: adduser.

       --firstuid ID
       --lastuid ID
       --firstgid ID
       --lastgid ID
              Override  the  first  UID  /  last  UID  /  first  GID  /  last GID in the range that the uid is chosen from
              (FIRST_UID, LAST_UID,  FIRST_GID  and  LAST_GID,  FIRST_SYSTEM_UID,  LAST_SYSTEM_UID,  FIRST_SYSTEM_GID  and
              LAST_SYSTEM_GID  in the configuration file).  If a group is created as a usergroup, --firstgid and --lastgid
              are ignored.  The group gets the same ID as the user.  Valid Modes: adduser, adduser --system, for  --first‐
              gid and --lastgid also addgroup.

       --force-badname
       --allow-badname
              These are the deprecated forms of --allow-bad-names.  It will be removed during the release cycle of the De‐
              bian release after bookworm.

       --extrausers
              Uses extra users as the database.

       --gid ID
              When  creating a group, this option sets the group ID number of the new group to GID.  When creating a user,
              this option sets the primary group ID number of the new user to GID.  Valid Modes: adduser,  adduser  --sys‐
              tem, addgroup, addgroup --system.

       --group
              Using  this  option in adduser --system indicates that the new user should get an identically named group as
              its primary group.  If that identically named group is not already present, it is created.  If not  combined
              with  --system,  a group with the given name is created.  The latter is the default action if the program is
              invoked as addgroup.  Valid Modes: adduser --system, addgroup, addgroup --system.

       --help Display brief instructions.

       --home dir
              Use dir as the user's home directory, rather than the  default  specified  by  the  configuration  file  (or
              /nonexistent  if  adduser  --system is used).  If the directory does not exist, it is created.  Valid Modes:
              adduser, adduser --system.

       --ingroup GROUP
              When creating a user, this option sets the primary group ID number of the new user to the GID of  the  named
              group.   Unlike with the --gid option, the group is specified here by name rather than by numeric ID number.
              The group must already exist.  Valid Modes: adduser, adduser --system.

       --lastuid ID
       --lastgid ID
              Override the last UID / last GID.  See --firstuid.

       --no-create-home
              Do not create a home directory for the new user.  Note that the pathname for the new user's  home  directory
              will still be entered in the appropriate field in the /etc/passwd file.  The use of this option does not im‐
              ply  that this field should be empty.  Rather, it indicates to adduser that some other mechanism will be re‐
              sponsible for initializing the new user's home directory.  Valid Modes: adduser, adduser --system.

       --quiet
              Synonymous to --stdoutmsglevel=warn. Deprecated.

       --shell shell
              Use shell as the user's login shell, rather than  the  default  specified  by  the  configuration  file  (or
              /usr/sbin/nologin if adduser --system is used).  Valid Modes: adduser, adduser --system.

       --system
              Nomally, adduser creates dynamically allocated user accounts and groups as defined in Debian Policy, Chapter
              9.2.2.  With this option, adduser creates a dynamically allocated system user and group and changes its mode
              respectively.  Valid Modes: adduser, addgroup.

       --uid ID
              Force  the  new  userid  to  be  the given number.  adduser will fail if the userid is already taken.  Valid
              Modes: adduser, adduser --system.

       --verbose
              Synonymous to --stdoutmsglevel=info. Deprecated.

       --stdoutmsglevel prio
       --stderrmsglevel prio
       --logmsglevel prio
              Minimum priority for messages logged to syslog/journal and the console, respectively.  Values are trace, de‐
              bug, info, warn, err, and fatal.  Messages with the priority set here or higher get printed to  the  respec‐
              tive medium.  Messages printed to stderr are not repeated on stdout.  That allows the local admin to control
              adduser's  chattiness on the console and in the log independently, keeping probably confusing information to
              itself while still leaving helpful information in the log.

       -v , --version
              Display version and copyright information.

EXIT VALUES
       0      Success: The user or group exists as specified.  This can have 2 causes: The user or group  was  created  by
              this  call to adduser or the user or group was already present on the system as specified before adduser was
              invoked.  If adduser --system is invoked for a user already existing with the requested  or  compatible  at‐
              tributes, it will also return 0.

       Or for many other yet undocumented reasons which are printed to console then.  You  may  then  consider  to  remove
       --quiet to make adduser more verbose.

SECURITY
       adduser  needs root privileges and offers, via the --conf command line option to use different configuration files.
       Do not use sudo(8) or similar tools to give partial privileges to adduser with restricted command line  parameters.
       This  is easy to circumvent and might allow users to create arbitrary accounts.  If you want this, consider writing
       your own wrapper script and giving privileges to execute that script.

FILES
       /etc/adduser.conf
              Default configuration file for adduser(8) and addgroup(8)

       /usr/local/sbin/adduser.local
              Optional custom add-ons, see adduser.local(8)

NOTES
       Unfortunately, the term system account suffers from double use in Debian.  It both means an account for the  actual
       Debian system, distinguishing itself from an application account which might exist in the user database of some ap‐
       plication running on Debian.  A system account in this definition has the potential to log in to the actual system,
       has  a UID, can be member in system groups, can own files and processes.  Debian Policy, au contraire, in its Chap‐
       ter 9.2.2, makes a distinguishment of dynamically allocated system users and groups and dynamically allocated  user
       accounts,  meaning in both cases special instances of system accounts.  Care must be taken to not confuse this ter‐
       minology.  Since adduser and deluser(8) never address application accounts and everything in this package  concerns
       system  accounts here, the usage of the terms user account and system account is actually not ambiguous in the con‐
       text of this package.  For clarity, this document uses the definition local system account or group if the distinc‐
       tion to application accounts or accounts managed in a directory service is needed.

       adduser used to have the vision to be the universal front end to the various directory services  for  creation  and
       deletion  of  regular  and system accounts in Debian since the 1990ies.  This vision has been abandoned as of 2022.
       The rationale behind this includes: that in practice, a small server system is not going to have write access to an
       enterprise-wide directory service anyway, that locally installed packages are hard to manage  with  centrally  con‐
       trolled system accounts, that enterprise directory services have their own management processes anyway and that the
       personpower of the adduser team is unlikely to be ever strong enough to write and maintain support for the plethora
       of directory services that need support.

       adduser  will constrict itself to being a policy layer for the management of local system accounts, using the tools
       from the password package for the actual work.

BUGS
       Inconsistent use of terminology around the term system account in docs and code is a bug.  Please report  this  and
       allow us to improve our docs.

       adduser  takes  special  attention to be directly usable in Debian maintainer scripts without conditional wrappers,
       error suppression and other scaffolding.  The only thing that the package maintainer should need to code is a check
       for the presence of the executable in the postrm script.  The adduser maintainers consider the need for  additional
       scaffolding a bug and encourage their fellow Debian package maintainers to file bugs against the adduser package in
       this case.

NAME
       apg - generates several random passwords

SYNOPSIS
       apg  [-a  algorithm]  [-M mode] [-E char_string] [-n num_of_pass] [-m min_pass_len] [-x max_pass_len] [-r dictfile]
       [-b filter_file] [-p min_substr_len] [-s] [-c cl_seed] [-d] [-y] [-l] [-t] [-q] [-h] [-v]

DESCRIPTION
       apg generates several random passwords. It uses several password generation algorithms (currently two) and a built-
       in pseudo random number generator.

       Default algorithm is pronounceable password generation algorithm designed by Morrie Gasser and described in A  Ran‐
       dom  Word  Generator  For  Pronounceable  Passwords National Technical Information Service (NTIS) AD-A-017676.  The
       original paper is very old and had never been put online, so  I  have  to  use  NIST  implementation  described  in
       FIPS-181.

       Another  algorithm  is  simple  random character generation algorithm, but it uses four user-defined symbol sets to
       produce random password. It means that user can choose type of symbols that should appear in password. Symbol  sets
       are:  numeric  symbol  set  (0,...,9), capital letters symbol set (A,...,Z), small letters symbol set (a,...,z) and
       special symbols symbol set (#,@,!,...).

       Built-in pseudo random number generator is an implementation of algorithm described in Appendix C of ANSI X9.17  or
       RFC 1750 with exception that it uses CAST or SHA-1 instead of Triple DES.  It uses local time with precision of mi‐
       croseconds (see gettimeofday(2)) and /dev/random (if available) to produce initial random seed.

       apg  also  have  the  ability to check generated password quality using dictionary. You can use this ability if you
       specify command-line options -r dictfile or -b filtername where dictfile is the dictionary file name and filtername
       is the name of Bloom filter file. In that dictionary you may place words (one per line) that should not  appear  as
       generated passwords. For example: user names, common words, etc. You even can use one of the dictionaries that come
       with dictionary password crackers.  Bloom filter file should be created with apgbfm(1) utility included in apg dis‐
       tribution.  In  future  releases  I plan to implement some other techniques to check passwords (like pattern check)
       just to make life easier.

OPTIONS
   Password generation modes options
       -a algorithm
              Use algorithm for password generation.
              0 - pronounceable password generation (default)
              1 - random character password generation

       -n num_of_pass
              Generate num_of_pass number of passwords. Default is 6.

       -m min_pass_len
              Generate password with minimum length min_pass_len.  If min_pass_len  >  max_pass_len  then  max_pass_len  =
              min_pass_len.  Default minimum password length is 8.

       -x max_pass_len
              Generate  password  with  maximum  length  max_pass_len.  If min_pass_len > max_pass_len then max_pass_len =
              min_pass_len.  Default maximum password length is 10.

       -M mode
              Use symbolsets specified with mode for password generation.  mode is a text string consisting of  characters
              S, s, N, n, C, c, L, l. Where:

              S      Generator must use special symbol set for every generated password.

              s      Generator should use special symbol set for password generation.

              N      Generator must use numeral symbol set for every generated password.

              n      Generator should use numeral symbol set for password generation.

              C      Generator must use capital symbol set for every generated password.

              c      Generator should use capital symbol set for password generation.

              L      Generator  must  use  small  letters  symbol set for every generated password (always present if pro‐
                     nounceable password generation algorithm is used).

              l      Generator should use small letters symbol set for password generation.

              R,r    Not supported any more. Use -E char_string option instead.
              mode can not be more than 4 characters in length.

              Note:
              Usage of L, M, S, C will slow down password generation process.

              Examples:
              -M sncl
              -M SNCL
              -M Cn

       -E char_string
              Exclude characters in char_string from password generation process  (in  pronounceable  password  generation
              mode  you  can not exclude small letters). To include special symbols that can be recognized by shell (apos‐
              trophe, quotes, dollar sign, etc.) in char_string use the backslashed versions.

              Examples:

              Command apg -a 1 -M n -n 3 -m 8 -E 23456789 will generate a set of passwords that will look like this:
              10100110
              01111000
              11011101

              Command apg -a 1 -M nc -n 3 -m 26 -E GHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ will generate a set of passwords  that  will  look
              like this:
              16A1653CD4DE5E7BD9584A3476
              C8F78E06944AFD57FB9CB882BC
              8C8DF37CD792D36D056BBD5002

   Password quality control options
       -r dictfile
              Check generated passwords for their appearance in dictfile

       -b filter_file
              Check  generated  passwords for their appearance in filter_file. filter_file should be created with the apg‐
              bfm(1) utility.

       -p min_substr_len
              This option tells apg(1) to check every substring of the generated password for appearance  in  filter_file.
              If  any  of  such substrings would be found in the filter_file then generated password would be rejected and
              apg(1) will generate another one.  min_substr_len specifies minimum substring length to check.  This  option
              is active only if -b option is defined.

   Pseudo random number generator options
       -s     Ask user for random sequence for password generation

       -c cl_seed
              Use  cl_seed as a random seed for password generation. I use it when i have to generate passwords in a shell
              script.
              Examples:
              -c /dev/urandom
              -c /tmp/seed_file

   Password output options
       -d     Do NOT use any delimiters between generated passwords. I use it when i have to generate passwords in a shell
              script.

       -y     Print generated passwords and crypted passwords (see crypt(3))

       -q     Quiet mode (do not print warnings)

       -l     Spell generated passwords. Useful when you want to read generated password by telephone.
              WARNING: Think twice before read your password by phone.

       -t     Print pronunciation for generated pronounceable password. Ignored if -a 1 is set.

       -h     Print help information and exit

       -v     Print version information and exit

DEFAULT OPTIONS
       apg -a 0 -M sncl -n 6 -x 10 -m 8 (new style)

       If you want to generate really secure passwords, you should use option -s. To simplify apg usage, you can  write  a
       small shell script. For example:
       [begin]----> pwgen.sh
       #!/bin/sh
       /usr/local/bin/apg -m 8 -x 12 -s
       [ end ]----> pwgen.sh

EXIT CODE
       On  successful  completion  of its task, apg will complete with exit code 0.  An exit code of -1 indicates an error
       occurred.  Textual errors are written to the standard error stream.

DIAGNOSTICS
       If /dev/random is not available, apg will display a message about it.

FILES
       None.

BUGS
       None.  If you've found one, please send bug description to the author.

NAME
       apt-cdrom - APT CD-ROM management utility

SYNOPSIS

       apt-cdrom [-rmfan] [-d=cdrom_mount_point] [-o=config_string] [-c=config_file] {add | ident | {-v | --version} |
                 {-h | --help}}

DESCRIPTION
       apt-cdrom is used to add a new CD-ROM to APT's list of available sources.  apt-cdrom takes care of determining the
       structure of the disc as well as correcting for several possible mis-burns and verifying the index files.

       It is necessary to use apt-cdrom to add CDs to the APT system; it cannot be done by hand. Furthermore each disc in
       a multi-CD set must be inserted and scanned separately to account for possible mis-burns.

       Unless the -h, or --help option is given, one of the commands below must be present.

       add
           add is used to add a new disc to the source list. It will unmount the CD-ROM device, prompt for a disc to be
           inserted and then proceed to scan it and copy the index files. If the disc does not have a proper .disk
           directory you will be prompted for a descriptive title.

           APT uses a CD-ROM ID to track which disc is currently in the drive and maintains a database of these IDs in
           /var/lib/apt/cdroms.list

       ident
           A debugging tool to report the identity of the current disc as well as the stored file name

OPTIONS
       All command line options may be set using the configuration file, the descriptions indicate the configuration
       option to set. For boolean options you can override the config file by using something like -f-,--no-f, -f=no or
       several other variations.

       --no-auto-detect, --cdrom
           Do not try to auto-detect the CD-ROM path. Usually combined with the --cdrom option. Configuration Item:
           Acquire::cdrom::AutoDetect.

       -d, --cdrom
           Mount point; specify the location to mount the CD-ROM. This mount point must be listed in /etc/fstab and
           properly configured. Configuration Item: Acquire::cdrom::mount.

       -r, --rename
           Rename a disc; change the label of a disc or override the disc's given label. This option will cause apt-cdrom
           to prompt for a new label. Configuration Item: APT::CDROM::Rename.

       -m, --no-mount
           No mounting; prevent apt-cdrom from mounting and unmounting the mount point. Configuration Item:
           APT::CDROM::NoMount.

       -f, --fast
           Fast Copy; Assume the package files are valid and do not check every package. This option should be used only
           if apt-cdrom has been run on this disc before and did not detect any errors. Configuration Item:
           APT::CDROM::Fast.

       -a, --thorough
           Thorough Package Scan; This option may be needed with some old Debian 1.1/1.2 discs that have Package files in
           strange places. It takes much longer to scan the CD but will pick them all up.

       -n, --just-print, --recon, --no-act
           No Changes; Do not change the sources.list(5) file and do not write index files. Everything is still checked
           however. Configuration Item: APT::CDROM::NoAct.

       -h, --help
           Show a short usage summary.

       -v, --version
           Show the program version.

       -c, --config-file
           Configuration File; Specify a configuration file to use. The program will read the default configuration file
           and then this configuration file. If configuration settings need to be set before the default configuration
           files are parsed specify a file with the APT_CONFIG environment variable. See apt.conf(5) for syntax
           information.

       -o, --option
           Set a Configuration Option; This will set an arbitrary configuration option. The syntax is -o Foo::Bar=bar.  -o
           and --option can be used multiple times to set different options.
